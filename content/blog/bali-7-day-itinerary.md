# Bali 7-Day Itinerary: The Practical Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Bali gets a lot of hype. Some of it is deserved — the rice terraces are genuinely stunning, the food is absurdly cheap, and a villa with a private pool costs less than a budget hotel in most European cities. Some of it is Instagram fantasy. The reality is somewhere in between.

This 7-day itinerary is built for first-time visitors who want to see the highlights without spending half their trip stuck in traffic between Kuta and Ubud. It's based on real distances, real 2026 prices, and actual places we'd recommend to a friend — not whatever paid the most for a TripAdvisor listing.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Best Time to Visit

Bali's dry season runs **April through October**. This is when you want to be there. Skies are clear, humidity is manageable, and you won't get caught in afternoon downpours.

**November through March** is wet season. It still doesn't rain all day — usually a heavy burst in the afternoon — but roads flood, some boat services to Nusa Penida get cancelled, and everything feels stickier. If wet season is your only option, it's still worth going. Just bring a rain jacket and be flexible.

Peak tourist months are **July, August, and late December**. Prices jump 30-50% and popular restaurants need reservations.

### Getting Around

Transport is Bali's biggest pain point. There's no public transit system worth mentioning. Your options:

- **Scooter rental:** $5-8/day. By far the most common and cheapest option. You need an international driving permit (IDP) technically, though enforcement is sporadic. Bali traffic is chaotic — if you've never ridden a motorbike, this isn't the place to learn.
- **Grab (Southeast Asia's Uber):** Works well in Seminyak, Canggu, and Kuta. Less reliable in Ubud and rural areas. A 30-minute ride costs $3-6.
- **Private driver for the day:** $35-50 for 8-10 hours. This is the move for day trips to Uluwatu or doing the Ubud temple circuit. Your hotel or villa can arrange one. Agree on the price before you leave.
- **Gojek:** Grab's competitor. Same prices, sometimes better availability. Download both apps.

**Critical tip:** Getting from Ngurah Rai airport to Ubud takes 1.5-2 hours in traffic. Don't arrive at night thinking you'll zip to your villa. Book an airport transfer through your hotel ($25-35) or use the official airport taxi counter.

### Money & Costs

Bali uses **Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)**. The exchange rate in early 2026 sits around 15,800 IDR to $1 USD. Prices in tourist areas are often quoted in dollars, especially for accommodation.

ATMs are everywhere in tourist zones. Use BCA, Mandiri, or CIMB machines — they charge lower fees. Withdraw in larger amounts to minimize the per-transaction fee (usually 30,000-50,000 IDR / $2-3).

Credit cards are accepted at mid-range and upscale restaurants, hotels, and shops. Warungs (local eateries), market stalls, and small shops are **cash only**.

### Budget Breakdown (Per Person, Per Day)

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Accommodation | $15-30 | $50-120 | $200+ |
| Food | $8-15 | $20-40 | $60+ |
| Transport | $5-10 | $15-25 | $40+ |
| Activities | $5-15 | $20-50 | $80+ |
| **Daily Total** | **$33-70** | **$105-235** | **$380+** |

Yes, you can do Bali on $40/day if you stay in guesthouses, eat at warungs, and ride a scooter. Most travelers land in the $80-150/day range and live very comfortably.

## Days 1-2: Ubud — Rice Terraces, Temples & Jungle

Ubud is Bali's cultural heart. It's not the beach town you might expect — it's inland, surrounded by rice paddies and jungle, and attracts the yoga-retreat-and-organic-smoothie crowd. But underneath the wellness veneer, it's a genuinely beautiful place with some of the best food on the island.

### Day 1: Arrive & Explore Ubud Center

If you're flying in, head straight to Ubud. Yes, it's a long drive from the airport (1.5-2 hours). But starting here means you beat the crowds at the major sights before the day-trippers from Seminyak arrive.

**Afternoon: Ubud Monkey Forest (2:00 PM)**

The **Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary** is right in central Ubud. It's a moss-covered temple complex with 1,260+ long-tailed macaques roaming free.

- **Entrance:** 80,000 IDR ($5)
- **Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours
- **Rules:** Don't bring food, remove dangling accessories, and don't make eye contact with the monkeys for too long. They will grab your sunglasses. It happens daily.

**Late Afternoon: Ubud Art Market & Palace (4:00 PM)**

Walk 10 minutes north to the **Ubud Art Market** (Pasar Seni Ubud). Open daily, best in the morning for serious shopping, but the afternoon is less crowded. Silk scarves ($5-10), woven bags ($3-8), and paintings ($10-50). Bargain — start at 40% of the asking price.

Across the street is **Ubud Royal Palace** (Puri Saren Agung). Free to walk through the courtyard during the day. On most evenings, there's a traditional **Balinese dance performance** at 7:30 PM (100,000 IDR / $6.30).

**Dinner: Warung Options**

- **Warung Biah Biah:** Traditional Balinese food, stunning rice paddy views. Nasi campur (mixed rice plate) for 45,000 IDR ($2.85).
- **Ibu Oka:** Famous for babi guling (suckling pig). Anthony Bourdain put it on the map. A plate costs 65,000 IDR ($4.10). Non-pork eaters: skip this one and go to **Warung Teges** for chicken and tempeh dishes ($2-4).

### Day 2: Rice Terraces & Waterfalls

This is a full-day adventure. Hire a driver ($35-45 for the day) or rent a scooter if you're experienced.

**Morning: Tegallalang Rice Terraces (8:00 AM)**

The most photographed spot in Bali, and for good reason. Arrive early — by 10 AM it's packed with tour groups.

- **Entrance:** 25,000 IDR ($1.60) plus small donations requested at various viewpoints along the path
- **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Tip:** Walk past the first viewing platform. The further you go down the terraces, the fewer people you'll see. The swing photos you've seen on Instagram? Those are at commercial photo spots that charge $10-35 for the experience. Honestly, the view from the free walking path is better.

**Mid-Morning: Tirta Empul Temple (10:30 AM)**

A 20-minute drive from Tegallalang. This is Bali's most important water temple, where Balinese Hindus come for ritual purification under 30 stone waterspouts.

- **Entrance:** 50,000 IDR ($3.15) plus sarong rental if needed
- **Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours
- **Can you participate?** Yes. Tourists are welcome to enter the purification pools. Wear a sarong (provided at entrance), follow the local worshippers, and start from the left. It's a genuinely moving experience if you approach it respectfully.

**Afternoon: Tegenungan Waterfall (1:00 PM)**

A 30-minute drive south. This is Ubud's most accessible waterfall — a short walk down concrete steps instead of a jungle trek.

- **Entrance:** 20,000 IDR ($1.25)
- **Bring:** Swimsuit, water shoes (rocks are slippery), and a dry bag for your phone
- **Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours

For a less crowded alternative, drive an extra 30 minutes to **Tibumana Waterfall** — smaller but far more peaceful.

**Evening: Ubud Dinner**

- **Locavore** (if you want to splurge): One of Bali's best restaurants. Indonesian ingredients, modern technique. Tasting menu $85-110/person. Book 2 weeks ahead.
- **Clear Cafe:** Popular with the health-conscious crowd. Big portions, creative menu. $6-10/dish.
- **Warung Makan Tepi Sawah:** Eat on a bamboo platform over rice fields. Mains $3-6.

## Days 3-4: Seminyak & Canggu — Beaches, Beach Clubs & Sunsets

Time to shift from jungle to coast. The drive from Ubud to Seminyak takes about 1-1.5 hours depending on traffic. Check out of Ubud by mid-morning.

### Day 3: Seminyak

Seminyak is Bali's most polished beach area — upscale boutiques, good restaurants, and beach clubs that range from chill to full-on party. It's more expensive than the rest of Bali but still cheap by Western standards.

**Afternoon: Beach & Sunset (2:00 PM)**

Drop your bags at your accommodation and head to **Seminyak Beach**. The sand is darker than postcard Bali — this is a surf and sunset beach, not a snorkeling beach.

Rent a sun lounger from one of the beach-side vendors ($3-5 for the day, sometimes free if you order drinks). Grab a Bintang beer ($2-3) and settle in.

**Sunset: Potato Head Beach Club (5:00 PM)**

Walk south to **Potato Head** — an architectural icon built from recycled shutters. Get there by 5 PM to secure a good seat for sunset. Entry is free, but there's a minimum spend of around 250,000-350,000 IDR ($16-22) on food and drinks.

Other sunset options:
- **Ku De Ta:** The OG Seminyak beach club. More upscale. Cocktails $10-14.
- **La Plancha:** Budget-friendly, colorful bean bags on the sand. Cocktails $6-8. Less pretentious, great atmosphere.

**Dinner: Seminyak**

- **Mama San:** Asian fusion in a colonial warehouse. Mains $10-18. Book ahead.
- **Warung Bonita:** Hidden gem. Balinese home cooking, generous portions, $3-6 per dish. Walk past the tourist strip to find it.
- **Naughty Nuri's:** Famous for BBQ pork ribs and dirty martinis. Ribs $8-12.

### Day 4: Canggu

Canggu is 25 minutes north of Seminyak and has become Bali's digital nomad and surfer capital. It's more laid-back, slightly cheaper, and has better surf.

**Morning: Surf Lesson at Batu Bolong (8:00 AM)**

**Batu Bolong Beach** has gentle waves perfect for beginners. A 2-hour surf lesson costs $25-35 including board rental. If you already surf, just rent a board ($5-8/day) and paddle out.

**Brunch: Canggu Cafe Scene (10:30 AM)**

Canggu has possibly the highest density of brunch cafes per square kilometer in Southeast Asia.

- **Crate Cafe:** Excellent coffee, acai bowls, eggs. $5-9.
- **The Shady Shack:** Vegetarian/vegan, relaxed garden setting. $4-7.
- **Milk & Madu:** Big portions, good coffee, always busy. $6-10.

**Afternoon: Tanah Lot Temple (3:00 PM)**

Drive 30 minutes northwest to **Tanah Lot**, one of Bali's most iconic temples. It sits on a rock formation in the ocean — spectacular at sunset.

- **Entrance:** 60,000 IDR ($3.80)
- **Time needed:** 1-2 hours
- **Tip:** You can't enter the temple itself (it's an active place of worship), but the setting is the attraction. Arrive by 4 PM for photos, stay for sunset around 6:15-6:30 PM.

**Evening: Canggu Nightlife**

Canggu has replaced Kuta as the party zone. **Old Man's** is the iconic spot (live music, cheap beers, young crowd). **Deus Ex Machina** combines a motorcycle workshop, coffee shop, and bar — surprisingly cool. For something more mellow, **The Lawn** has oceanfront cocktails.

---

## Day 5: Uluwatu — Clifftop Temples & the Kecak Dance

The Bukit Peninsula (southern tip of Bali) is dramatically different from the north — limestone cliffs, hidden beaches, and some of the best surf breaks in the world.

**Morning: Uluwatu Beaches (9:00 AM)**

Head south from Seminyak/Canggu (45-60 minutes by scooter or car). Stop at one of Uluwatu's famous cliff beaches:

- **Padang Padang Beach:** Small, beautiful, and famous from the movie "Eat Pray Love." Gets crowded by noon. Free entry, 15,000 IDR ($0.95) parking.
- **Thomas Beach:** Quieter alternative nearby. Same white sand, fewer people.
- **Melasti Beach:** Bali's most photogenic beach — white cliffs framing turquoise water. 10,000 IDR ($0.65) entrance.

**Afternoon: Lunch at Single Fin (1:00 PM)**

**Single Fin** is a clifftop bar and restaurant overlooking the legendary Uluwatu surf break. Burgers $6-9, cocktails $6-8. The view alone is worth the trip. On Sundays they host a famous sunset party.

**Late Afternoon: Uluwatu Temple (4:00 PM)**

**Pura Luhur Uluwatu** is perched on a 70-meter cliff above the Indian Ocean. It's one of Bali's six key temples and possibly the most dramatically located temple in all of Southeast Asia.

- **Entrance:** 50,000 IDR ($3.15)
- **Important:** Monkeys here are aggressive and strategic. They will steal your sunglasses, phone, or hat and hold them for ransom (a temple worker will negotiate their return with food). Secure everything. This isn't a joke — they've evolved this behavior over years.

**Sunset: Kecak Fire Dance (6:00 PM)**

The **Kecak dance** at Uluwatu Temple is one of Bali's most unforgettable experiences. Fifty or more men sit in concentric circles, chanting "chak-chak-chak" in rhythm while performers act out the Hindu Ramayana epic — all set against the backdrop of the sun sinking into the ocean.

- **Tickets:** 150,000 IDR ($9.50). Buy in advance at the temple entrance — it sells out.
- **Duration:** ~1 hour
- **Seating:** Arrive by 5:30 PM for a good spot. The amphitheater is open-air and seats about 700 people.

This is not a tourist show bolted on for visitors. The Kecak tradition dates to the 1930s and is performed by local community members. It's raw, hypnotic, and completely different from anything you've seen.

**Dinner:** Head back north or eat in Jimbaran at **Jimbaran Bay** — a row of seafood restaurants directly on the sand. You pick your fish from the display, they grill it over coconut husks. A full seafood dinner runs $12-20/person. Order the grilled prawns.

---

## Day 6: Nusa Penida Day Trip

Nusa Penida is a separate island 45 minutes by fast boat from Bali's southeast coast. It has Bali's most dramatic landscapes — the kind that make your brain struggle to process that they're real.

### Getting There

Fast boats depart from **Sanur Harbor** between 7:00-9:00 AM. Round-trip tickets cost $15-25. Book with **Maruti Express**, **Angel Billabong Fast Cruise**, or through your hotel. The crossing can be rough — take motion sickness medication if you're prone.

You'll arrive at **Toya Pakeh** or **Banjar Nyuh** harbor. Hire a driver with a car for the day ($35-50) — the roads on Nusa Penida are narrow, steep, and genuinely dangerous on a scooter. This is not the day to save $20.

### The Route

**Stop 1: Kelingking Beach (9:30 AM)**

The T-Rex-shaped cliff that's been on every Bali Instagram feed. The viewpoint is a short walk from the parking area. The descent to the beach itself takes 30-40 minutes on a steep, exposed trail with minimal handrails — only attempt it if you're fit, wearing proper shoes, and have water.

- **Entrance:** 25,000 IDR ($1.60)
- **Time needed:** 1-2 hours (viewpoint only: 30 minutes)

**Stop 2: Angel's Billabong & Broken Beach (11:30 AM)**

A 15-minute drive east. Angel's Billabong is a natural infinity pool carved into the coastline. Broken Beach is a dramatic circular cove with a natural rock bridge. Both are free to visit and are genuinely jaw-dropping.

- **Time needed:** 45 minutes for both
- **Warning:** Don't swim in Angel's Billabong when waves are high. People have died here. Check conditions with your driver.

**Stop 3: Crystal Bay (1:30 PM)**

End the land portion at **Crystal Bay**, the best swimming and snorkeling beach on Nusa Penida. White sand, clear water, coral reef right off shore.

- **Snorkel gear rental:** 50,000 IDR ($3.15)
- **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Lunch:** Small warungs on the beach serve nasi goreng (fried rice) and fresh fish for $3-5.

### Optional: Manta Ray Snorkeling

If you have extra budget, book a **manta ray snorkeling trip** from Nusa Penida. Manta Point is one of the world's most reliable spots to swim with oceanic manta rays (3-5 meter wingspan). Trips cost $25-40/person and depart from Crystal Bay or Toya Pakeh.

Catch the return boat by 4:00-5:00 PM (last boats leave around 5:30 PM).

---

## Day 7: Spa Day & Departure

Your last day. Keep it relaxed.

**Morning: Balinese Spa Treatment (9:00 AM)**

A proper Balinese massage is practically mandatory before leaving. The quality-to-price ratio is unreal compared to anywhere in the West.

- **1-hour traditional Balinese massage:** $8-15 at a local spa, $25-50 at a resort spa
- **2-hour spa package** (massage + body scrub + flower bath): $20-35 at mid-range spas, $60-100 at luxury spas
- **Top picks:** **Bodyworks** in Seminyak (professional, clean, $12-25), **Karsa Spa** in Ubud (riverside setting, $15-30), or **Spring Spa** in Seminyak (upscale without the resort markup)

**Late Morning: Last Shopping & Food (11:00 AM)**

Pick up any last souvenirs. Best buys in Bali:
- **Coffee:** Bali-grown beans from Kintamani. $5-8 per bag at local shops (skip the overpriced luwak coffee — it's ethically questionable and often fake).
- **Textiles:** Batik fabric or ikat weavings. $10-30 for quality pieces at Ubud Art Market.
- **Silver jewelry:** Celuk village near Ubud is the silver-working center. Handmade rings $5-15.
- **Incense and essential oils:** Ubud has excellent quality. $2-5 per pack.

**Last Lunch**

Treat yourself to one final meal. If you're near Seminyak, **Sarong** does incredible Indonesian fine dining ($15-25/person). In Canggu, **Ji Terrace by the Sea** has ocean views and great Indonesian-Asian fusion ($10-18).

**Airport Transfer**

Allow **2 hours** from Seminyak or Canggu to the airport. From Ubud, allow **2.5 hours**. Bali traffic is unpredictable, especially between 4-7 PM. Don't cut it close.

## Total 7-Day Budget

**The honest truth:** Most travelers doing this itinerary at a comfortable mid-range level spend **$120-180/day** ($840-1,260 total). That gets you a nice villa or boutique hotel, great restaurants, all the major sights, and a couple of splurges.

## FAQ

### Is 7 days enough for Bali?

Seven days covers the essential areas: Ubud (culture and nature), Seminyak/Canggu (beaches and nightlife), Uluwatu (temples and cliffs), and a Nusa Penida day trip. It's tight but doable. If you have 10 days, add the Gili Islands or spend more time in Ubud exploring the northern volcanoes and hot springs.

### Is Bali safe for tourists in 2026?

Bali is one of the safest destinations in Southeast Asia. Violent crime against tourists is extremely rare. The main risks are scooter accidents (the #1 cause of tourist injuries), petty theft (don't leave valuables on the beach), and rip currents at some beaches. Get travel insurance that covers motorbike use if you plan to ride.

### What's the best area to stay in Bali?

It depends on your vibe. **Ubud** for culture, nature, and wellness. **Seminyak** for upscale dining, shopping, and beach clubs. **Canggu** for surfing, digital nomad cafes, and a younger crowd. **Uluwatu** for dramatic cliff-top scenery and world-class surf. Most 7-day itineraries split between 2-3 areas.

### Do I need a visa for Bali?

Most nationalities get a **Visa on Arrival (VOA)** valid for 30 days, costing 500,000 IDR (~$32). It's extendable once for another 30 days. In 2026, Indonesia also offers an e-VOA you can purchase online before arrival at molina.imigrasi.go.id — saves time at the airport.

### When is the cheapest time to visit Bali?

**February through April** (excluding Easter week) offers the lowest prices. It's technically wet season, but March and April are the tail end with less rain. Flights and accommodation can be 30-40% cheaper than peak season. The sweet spot for value is **May or September** — dry season weather with shoulder-season prices.
