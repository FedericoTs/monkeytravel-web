# 15 Cheapest Destinations in Asia for 2026 (Real Daily Budgets)

Asia remains the undisputed champion of budget travel in 2026, and it's not even close. While a budget day in Western Europe runs $80-120 and even Eastern Europe pushes $50-70, you can eat three meals, sleep in a clean room, and visit ancient temples in parts of Asia for less than what a mediocre dinner costs in Paris.

But "Asia is cheap" is a lazy generalization. Bangkok isn't what it was in 2010. Singapore will bankrupt you faster than London. And even within cheap countries, tourist zones inflate prices dramatically.

So we got specific. This is a ranked list of 15 destinations where your money stretches furthest in 2026 — with real daily budgets based on actual hostel prices, street food costs, and transport fares. Not "approximately affordable" — actual numbers.

---

## How We Calculated These Budgets

Every daily budget in this guide includes:

- **Accommodation:** Budget = dorm beds or basic guesthouses. Mid-range = private rooms in well-reviewed hotels.
- **Food:** Three meals a day, primarily street food and local restaurants for budget, mix of local and nicer sit-down for mid-range.
- **Transport:** Local buses, trains, tuk-tuks, or shared rides within the city.
- **Activities:** 1-2 paid attractions or experiences per day.

Prices are in USD, based on early 2026 data. International flights are not included — we're talking about what you spend once you're there.

## 1. Hanoi, Vietnam

**Daily Budget: $18-25 | Mid-Range: $40-55**

Hanoi is the best-value capital city in Southeast Asia, full stop. A bowl of pho from a street stall costs $1.50. A bia hoi (fresh draft beer) runs $0.25 — twenty-five cents. You can eat like royalty for the price of a gas station sandwich back home.

**Highlights:**
- The Old Quarter is a sensory overload of motorbikes, street vendors, and 1,000-year-old architecture crammed into 36 narrow streets
- Hoan Kiem Lake at dawn, when locals practice tai chi and the city hasn't woken up yet
- The Temple of Literature — Vietnam's first university, dating to 1070 AD

**Food tip:** Skip the restaurants near Hoan Kiem Lake. Walk 10 minutes to any plastic-stool-on-the-sidewalk operation on Hang Buom or Hang Bac streets. Bun cha (grilled pork with noodles, the dish Obama ate with Anthony Bourdain) costs $2 and it's life-changing.

**Pro tip:** Grab (the ride-hailing app) is cheaper than negotiating with taxi drivers, and you avoid the "broken meter" scam. A 20-minute ride across the city costs $1.50-2.50.

---

## 2. Siem Reap, Cambodia

**Daily Budget: $20-28 | Mid-Range: $45-65**

The gateway to Angkor Wat is shockingly cheap once you've bought the temple pass ($37 for a one-day pass, $62 for three days). Accommodation, food, and transport are among the lowest in Asia.

**Highlights:**
- Angkor Wat at sunrise — cliche for a reason. Get there by 5:00 AM and walk past the main reflecting pool to the less crowded north side
- Bayon Temple's 216 stone faces staring at you from every angle
- The floating villages on Tonle Sap Lake, where entire communities live on water

**Food tip:** Pub Street is the tourist zone — fine for a beer but overpriced for food. Head to the Kandal Village area or Old Market for Khmer dishes. Fish amok (coconut curry steamed in banana leaves) costs $2-3 at a local spot, $8-12 on Pub Street.

**Pro tip:** Rent a bicycle ($2-3/day) for the smaller temple circuits. It's flat terrain, distances are manageable, and you'll see temples the tuk-tuk tours skip entirely.

---

## 3. Kathmandu, Nepal

**Daily Budget: $15-22 | Mid-Range: $35-50**

Kathmandu might be the single cheapest city on this list. A dal bhat (rice and lentil platter with sides) — the national dish that fuels the Himalayas — costs $1.50-3 at a local restaurant and it's all-you-can-eat with refills. Guesthouses in Thamel start at $5-8/night.

**Highlights:**
- Boudhanath Stupa — one of the largest stupas in the world, surrounded by monasteries and prayer flags
- Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple) at sunset with panoramic valley views
- Durbar Square's medieval architecture, still being restored after the 2015 earthquake

**Food tip:** The momos (Tibetan dumplings) in Kathmandu are extraordinary. A plate of 10 steamed buffalo momos costs $1-2. Try the fried ones at a place called OR2K in Thamel or the steamed ones at any hole-in-the-wall on Jyatha Road.

**Pro tip:** Kathmandu is also the launching pad for some of the cheapest trekking in the world. The Annapurna Circuit permit costs $30 and tea house accommodation along the route runs $3-8/night with meals for $4-8. No other country offers Himalayan trekking at these prices.

---

## 4. Phnom Penh, Cambodia

**Daily Budget: $18-25 | Mid-Range: $40-60**

Cambodia's capital doesn't have Siem Reap's temples, but it has its own gritty charm and some of the cheapest living costs in Southeast Asia. The riverfront promenade at sunset is genuinely beautiful, and the food scene rivals cities twice its size.

**Highlights:**
- The Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda — still a functioning royal residence with extraordinary Khmer architecture
- Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the Killing Fields — essential, sobering history
- The Central Market (Phsar Thmei), an Art Deco dome built in 1937, packed with everything from jewelry to street food

**Food tip:** Eat at the Russian Market (Phsar Tuol Tom Poung). The food stalls inside serve massive plates of loc lac (stir-fried beef with rice) for $2-3. Get the sugarcane juice for $0.50 — you'll need it in the heat.

**Pro tip:** The night bus from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap costs $10-12 and takes about 6 hours. It saves you a night's accommodation. Book with Giant Ibis — they're the most reliable operator.

---

## 5. Luang Prabang, Laos

**Daily Budget: $22-30 | Mid-Range: $50-70**

Luang Prabang is the most beautiful small city in Southeast Asia — a UNESCO World Heritage town wedged between the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers. It's pricier than Vientiane, but the combination of French colonial architecture, Buddhist temples, and surrounding jungle is worth every dollar.

**Highlights:**
- The alms-giving ceremony at dawn, where hundreds of monks in saffron robes walk silently through the streets collecting offerings
- Kuang Si Falls — turquoise cascading waterfalls 30 minutes outside the city
- The night market on Sisavangvong Road, where Hmong artisans sell handwoven textiles for $5-15

**Food tip:** The morning market near the Royal Palace is where locals buy breakfast. Khao piak sen (Lao rice noodle soup) costs $1.50 and comes with a plate of fresh herbs. The Joma Bakery Cafe does excellent Lao coffee for $2 if you need an espresso fix.

**Pro tip:** Take the slow boat to/from Huay Xai (Thai border) — it's a two-day journey down the Mekong for $25-30 with an overnight stop in Pakbeng. One of the great budget travel experiences in Asia.

---

## 6. Vientiane, Laos

**Daily Budget: $18-25 | Mid-Range: $40-55**

Laos's capital is one of the most relaxed (and cheapest) capital cities in Asia. It feels more like a small town than a national capital — no skyscrapers, no real rush hour, just wide boulevards, crumbling French villas, and monks walking to morning prayers.

**Highlights:**
- Pha That Luang — Laos's most important national monument, a gold-covered stupa that glows at sunset
- Buddha Park (Xieng Khuan), 25 km outside the city — a surreal sculpture garden of giant concrete Buddhas and Hindu deities
- The Mekong riverfront at sunset with a Beer Lao ($1-1.50) in hand

**Food tip:** The evening food stalls along the Mekong promenade serve Lao BBQ (sin dat) — a tabletop grill where you cook your own marinated meats, with unlimited greens. It costs $4-6 per person and it's one of the best food experiences in the country.

**Pro tip:** Vientiane is a solid base for day trips. The bus to Vang Vieng costs $5-7 and takes 3-4 hours through dramatic karst mountain scenery.

---

## 7. Kolkata, India

**Daily Budget: $12-18 | Mid-Range: $30-45**

Kolkata (Calcutta) is India at its most intense, generous, and cheap. The daily budget here is almost absurdly low. Street food costs pennies. The metro is $0.10-0.25 per ride. And the city's intellectual and artistic heritage — it was the center of the Bengali Renaissance — gives it a cultural depth that rivals Delhi or Mumbai at a fraction of the cost.

**Highlights:**
- The Victoria Memorial — a white marble museum surrounded by gardens, equally stunning as the Taj Mahal but with no crowds
- Howrah Bridge at dawn, when the flower market underneath erupts in color and commerce
- College Street, the largest secondhand book market in the world

**Food tip:** Kolkata's street food is legendary. Kathi rolls (flatbread wraps stuffed with spiced meat or paneer) cost $0.40-0.80 at Nizam's or Hot Kathi Roll on Park Street. Puchka (crispy shells filled with spiced water) is $0.30 for a plate of six from any street vendor. It's the best thing you'll eat in India for under a dollar.

**Pro tip:** Take the Kolkata tram — the oldest operating tram network in Asia. A ride costs $0.10 and it's an experience in itself.

---

## 8. Yogyakarta, Indonesia

**Daily Budget: $15-22 | Mid-Range: $35-55**

Everyone goes to Bali. The savvy budget travelers go to Yogyakarta (locals call it "Jogja"). It's the cultural capital of Java — home to two UNESCO World Heritage temples that rival Angkor Wat — and costs half what you'd spend in Bali.

**Highlights:**
- Borobudur at sunrise — the world's largest Buddhist temple, a 9th-century monument with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues
- Prambanan, a Hindu temple complex from the same era, lit up spectacularly at night during the Ramayana Ballet performances
- The Sultan's Palace (Kraton), a living royal court where traditional Javanese culture is preserved

**Food tip:** Gudeg — jackfruit stewed in coconut milk with rice, chicken, and egg — is Jogja's signature dish. Get it at Gudeg Yu Djum for $1.50-2.50. For the full street food experience, hit Jalan Malioboro at night when dozens of lesehan (mat-style) restaurants line the sidewalks.

**Pro tip:** Rent a scooter ($4-5/day) and ride to the Jomblang Cave, a vertical cave where sunlight beams through a sinkhole into an underground river. It costs $35 for the guided tour, which is the biggest single expense you'll have in Jogja — and it's worth every cent.

---

## 9. Chiang Mai, Thailand

**Daily Budget: $22-30 | Mid-Range: $45-65**

Chiang Mai is where half the digital nomads in the world end up, and for good reason. The Old City is ringed by ancient walls and moats, stuffed with 300+ temples, and surrounded by mountains. The cost of living is low even by Thai standards, and the food is arguably Thailand's best.

**Highlights:**
- Doi Suthep temple, perched on a mountain overlooking the city — climb 309 steps (or take the tram)
- The Sunday Walking Street market — the best night market in Thailand, stretching over a kilometer through the Old City
- Cooking classes for $25-35 that include a market tour and 5-6 dishes you'll actually recreate at home

**Food tip:** Khao soi (coconut curry noodle soup topped with crispy noodles) is Chiang Mai's essential dish. Get it at Khao Soi Khun Yai on Charoen Rat Road — $1.50 for a bowl. The Warorot Market food court serves full meals (pad thai, curries, grilled meats) for $1-2.

**Pro tip:** Avoid elephant "sanctuaries" that let you ride elephants — it's harmful. The Elephant Nature Park ($80 for a full day) is the gold standard for ethical visits. It's expensive by local standards but it's the real deal.

---

## 10. Goa, India

**Daily Budget: $15-22 | Mid-Range: $35-55**

Goa is India's beach destination, and from November through March it's one of the cheapest places in Asia to plant yourself on a beautiful beach with a cold Kingfisher in hand. The Portuguese colonial heritage gives it a unique flavor — Catholic churches next to Hindu temples, vindaloo next to fish thalis.

**Highlights:**
- Palolem Beach in South Goa — a crescent of white sand that's gorgeous without being overrun
- Old Goa's basilicas and cathedrals, especially the Basilica of Bom Jesus (a UNESCO site housing the relics of St. Francis Xavier)
- The Saturday Night Market at Arpora — live music, food stalls from every cuisine, and handmade goods from local artisans

**Food tip:** The beach shacks are the thing. Fish thali (fish curry, rice, bread, pickles, and sides) costs $2-4 at a local shack. A whole grilled fish (usually pomfret or kingfish) runs $4-6. At a tourist restaurant, the same fish is $12-15. Eat at the shacks.

**Pro tip:** North Goa (Baga, Calangute, Anjuna) is the party zone — louder and more touristic. South Goa (Palolem, Agonda, Cabo de Rama) is quieter, cleaner, and slightly cheaper. If you want relaxation, go south.

---

## 11. Pokhara, Nepal

**Daily Budget: $15-22 | Mid-Range: $35-50**

Pokhara is Kathmandu's chill cousin — a lakeside town surrounded by the Annapurna range. The views of Machapuchare (Fishtail Mountain) reflected in Phewa Lake are the kind of scenery that postcards were invented for. It's also the base for Nepal's most popular treks.

**Highlights:**
- Sunrise at Sarangkot viewpoint — panoramic views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges
- Paragliding over Phewa Lake with Himalayan views ($65-80 for a 30-minute tandem flight — the cheapest Himalayan paragliding anywhere)
- The World Peace Pagoda, a white stupa on a hilltop with lake and mountain views in every direction

**Food tip:** Lakeside has plenty of tourist restaurants, but for real value head to the Old Bazaar area. Dal bhat at a local bhojanalaya (canteen) costs $1.50-2.50 with unlimited refills. The thakali set (a regional platter with 6-8 dishes) at Thakali Kitchen is $3-4 and it's one of the best meals in Nepal.

**Pro tip:** Rent a kayak on Phewa Lake for $2-3/hour and paddle to the Tal Barahi Temple on the island in the middle. It's peaceful, the views are incredible, and it costs almost nothing.

---

## 12. Mandalay, Myanmar

**Daily Budget: $20-28 | Mid-Range: $40-60**

Myanmar has been through turbulent times, and tourism has dropped significantly since 2021. For travelers who do visit in 2026, Mandalay offers extraordinary cultural richness at very low prices. It's the cultural and spiritual heart of Myanmar — more traditional and less touristy than Yangon.

**Highlights:**
- U Bein Bridge at sunset — the world's longest teak footbridge, 1.2 km across Taungthaman Lake
- Mandalay Hill at sunrise, with 360-degree views over the city and the Irrawaddy River
- The gold leaf workshops and marble carving streets where artisans still practice centuries-old crafts

**Food tip:** Shan noodles (rice noodles in a tomato-based sauce with minced pork) are Mandalay's best street food at $0.80-1.50 a bowl. The tea shops serve unlimited tea with your meal — order a plate of samosas ($0.30 each) and linger like the locals do.

**Pro tip:** Check your government's travel advisories before visiting Myanmar. Conditions vary by region. Mandalay and Bagan are generally accessible, but always verify current information and travel with a reputable local guide.

---

## 13. Galle, Sri Lanka

**Daily Budget: $22-30 | Mid-Range: $50-70**

Sri Lanka's costs have stabilized after the economic turbulence of 2022-2023, and Galle is the standout destination. The Dutch colonial fort — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — is a walled city of boutique shops, cafes, and crumbling ramparts overlooking the Indian Ocean. Outside the fort, real Sri Lankan prices kick in.

**Highlights:**
- Walking the Galle Fort ramparts at sunset — one of the best free experiences in Asia
- The Unawatuna beach, 10 minutes from Galle, with calm turquoise water and reef snorkeling
- Mirissa, 40 minutes east, for blue whale watching (November-April, $40-50 for a boat trip)

**Food tip:** Inside the fort, eat at the Fort Deli for a Sri Lankan rice and curry plate ($4-5). Outside the fort, the same meal at a local "rice and curry" spot costs $1.50-2.50 and comes with 5-6 vegetable curries, sambol, and papadum. Look for spots with a lunch crowd — high turnover means fresh food.

**Pro tip:** Take the coastal train from Colombo to Galle ($2-3 for a second-class ticket, 3 hours). It runs along the coast with ocean views the entire way. Sit on the left side heading south.

---

## 14. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

**Daily Budget: $20-28 | Mid-Range: $45-65**

Saigon (everyone still calls it that) is bigger, louder, and more modern than Hanoi — a city of 10 million people, 8 million motorbikes, and some of the best street food on the planet. It's slightly more expensive than Hanoi, but the food scene's depth and the city's energy make it worth every extra dollar.

**Highlights:**
- The War Remnants Museum — one of the most powerful war museums anywhere, deeply moving regardless of your nationality
- District 1's colonial architecture: the Central Post Office (designed by Gustave Eiffel), Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Opera House
- The Cu Chi Tunnels, 70 km northwest — the underground network used during the Vietnam War

**Food tip:** Banh mi (Vietnamese baguette sandwich) was perfected here. Banh Mi Huynh Hoa on Le Thi Rieng Street serves what many consider the best in the city for $2. Go early — the line gets long. For pho, Pho Le on Nam Ky Khoi Nghia Street has been serving the same recipe since 1968. A bowl costs $2.50.

**Pro tip:** The Mekong Delta is a 2-hour bus ride ($5-8) from the city. Skip the group tours and take a local bus to Ben Tre or Can Tho for an authentic floating market experience at a fraction of the tour price.

---

## 15. Ubud, Bali, Indonesia

**Daily Budget: $25-35 | Mid-Range: $50-80**

Ubud is the most expensive destination on this list, and it still costs less per day than a budget trip in most of Europe. The rice terraces, temple culture, and food scene make it the right kind of splurge. It's not a beach destination — it's jungle, art, and spirituality.

**Highlights:**
- Tegallalang Rice Terraces — the iconic green tiers that define Bali's visual identity
- The Sacred Monkey Forest, where 1,260 long-tailed macaques roam through ancient temple ruins
- Tirta Empul, a water temple where locals and visitors participate in a Hindu purification ritual

**Food tip:** Eat at warungs (local eateries), not the Instagram cafes. Warung Biah Biah serves authentic Balinese dishes for $2-4 — the nasi campur (mixed rice) is perfect. A smoothie bowl at a trendy cafe costs $7-10. A nasi goreng at a warung costs $1.50. Do the math.

**Pro tip:** Ubud's real magic is outside the town center. Rent a scooter ($4-6/day) and ride to Sidemen, an hour east, where the rice terraces are equally stunning but empty of tourists. Mount Agung looms in the background and you'll have the place to yourself.

## Tips That Apply Everywhere

**Money:**
- ATMs charge $2-5 per withdrawal in most Asian countries. Withdraw larger amounts less frequently. Charles Schwab and Wise debit cards reimburse ATM fees.
- Cash is king in budget destinations. Credit cards work at mid-range hotels and restaurants but not at street stalls, local transport, or markets.

**Accommodation:**
- Booking.com and Agoda often show different prices for the same hotel in Asia. Check both. Agoda is typically cheaper in Southeast Asia.
- Guesthouses booked in person are often cheaper than online listings, especially in Nepal, Laos, and Cambodia.

**Food:**
- If locals are eating there, eat there. If the menu has photos and prices in three currencies, walk away.
- Bottled water costs $0.25-0.50 everywhere. Budget $1-2/day for water. Bring a filtered bottle (Grayl or LifeStraw) to save money and plastic.

**Transport:**
- Domestic flights on budget airlines (AirAsia, VietJet, IndiGo) are often cheaper than overnight trains when booked 2-3 weeks ahead.
- Grab and Gojek work in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Myanmar. Always use them over unmetered taxis.

## FAQ

### What is the cheapest country in Asia for tourists in 2026?

Nepal and India are the cheapest overall. You can travel comfortably in Kolkata for $12-18/day and Kathmandu for $15-22/day. Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam are the cheapest in Southeast Asia, with daily budgets starting around $18-25.

### Is Southeast Asia still cheap in 2026?

Yes, though prices have risen 10-20% since pre-pandemic levels in popular tourist zones. Bali and Bangkok have seen the biggest increases. Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam remain exceptionally affordable. The best value is in secondary cities — Yogyakarta over Bali, Chiang Mai over Bangkok, Hoi An over Da Nang.

### How much money do I need for 2 weeks in Asia?

On a strict budget (dorms, street food, local transport): **$300-500** for Nepal or India, **$400-700** for Southeast Asia. Mid-range (private rooms, sit-down restaurants, occasional tours): **$700-1,200** for most destinations. These figures exclude international flights.

### Is it safe to eat street food in Asia?

Street food is generally safe if you follow basic rules: eat where locals eat, choose stalls with high turnover (food doesn't sit around), make sure meat is cooked fresh in front of you, and avoid raw vegetables washed in local water. Millions of locals eat street food daily — it's often safer than empty tourist restaurants because the ingredients don't sit.

### What's the best time to visit Southeast Asia on a budget?

Shoulder seasons offer the best value. **March-May** (before monsoons but after peak season) and **October-November** (monsoons ending, before Christmas rush) offer lower prices and fewer crowds. Avoid Christmas/New Year and Chinese New Year, when prices spike across the region.
