# International Travel Checklist 2026: Everything You Need Before Your Trip

Your international trip is booked. The excitement is real. But between the moment you buy that plane ticket and the moment you land in a new country, there is a long list of things that can go wrong if you don't prepare properly.

A forgotten visa application. An expired passport you didn't notice. A credit card that gets frozen the first time you use it abroad. A phone with no data and no offline maps in a city where you don't speak the language.

This checklist is designed to make sure none of that happens. It's organized as a countdown so you know exactly what to do and when to do it — starting three months before departure and ending at the airport gate.

Whether this is your first international trip or your twentieth, work through it from top to bottom. Even experienced travelers miss things.

## 3 Months Before Departure

This is when the big-ticket items need your attention. Some of these have long processing times, and leaving them until later creates real problems.

### Check Your Passport

This is the single most important item on the list. More international trips are ruined by passport issues than by anything else.

**The 6-month rule:** Over 70 countries require your passport to be valid for at least six months beyond your date of entry. This includes most of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Cambodia), the Middle East (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel), China, Russia, India, and many African nations.

**The 3-month rule:** Most European countries in the Schengen Zone require three months of validity beyond your planned departure date from the zone.

**Exceptions:** Canada and Mexico generally only require your passport to be valid for the duration of your stay.

**What to do right now:**
- Check your passport's expiration date
- If it expires within 8 months of your travel date, renew it now
- U.S. passport processing currently takes 10-13 weeks for routine service, plus mailing time in both directions
- Expedited service (4-6 weeks) costs an additional $60
- If you need it faster, you can book an in-person appointment at a passport agency for urgent travel within 14 days

**First-time travelers:** If you don't have a passport yet, apply immediately. First-time adult passports require an in-person appointment and cannot be done by mail. Budget at least 3 months.

### Research Visa Requirements

Visa requirements depend entirely on your nationality and destination. Don't assume you can just show up.

**Common scenarios for U.S. passport holders:**
- **Visa-free:** Most of Europe, UK, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Argentina, and many more (typically 30-90 day stays)
- **Visa on arrival:** Indonesia, Jordan, Cambodia, Egypt, and others (fees vary, usually $25-50)
- **eVisa (apply online before travel):** India, Australia, Turkey, Kenya, Sri Lanka, and many others
- **Traditional visa (embassy application):** China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and some African nations — these can take weeks to process

**ETIAS for Europe:** Starting in 2026, U.S. and other visa-exempt travelers will need an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) authorization to enter Schengen Zone countries. The application is done online, costs about 7 euros, and is valid for three years. Apply well before your trip.

**What to do:** Check the embassy website of every country you plan to visit. If an application is required, start it now.

Tools like [MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner](https://monkeytravel.app) can flag visa and document requirements for your specific destination during the planning phase, so you don't discover a requirement too late.

### Schedule Travel Vaccinations

Some vaccines require multiple doses spread over weeks, which is why this needs to happen early.

**Required vaccines:**
- **Yellow Fever:** Required for entry into certain countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Some countries require proof of vaccination if you've transited through a yellow fever zone.
- **Meningitis:** Required for Hajj pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia.

**Recommended vaccines (depending on destination):**
- **Hepatitis A:** Recommended for most developing countries. Available as a single shot providing protection for up to a year.
- **Hepatitis B:** Recommended for longer stays or if you might need medical treatment abroad. Requires a series of shots over 6 months (though an accelerated schedule exists).
- **Typhoid:** Recommended for South Asia, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa and Latin America.
- **Japanese Encephalitis:** Recommended for rural areas of Southeast Asia, Eastern Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.
- **Rabies:** Recommended if you'll be spending time around animals, caving, or in remote areas far from medical care.
- **Malaria prophylaxis:** Not a vaccine but prescription medication. Required for parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

**What to do:** Visit the CDC Travelers' Health website (wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel) and look up your specific destination. Schedule an appointment with a travel health clinic at least 4-6 weeks before departure.

### Get Travel Insurance

Travel insurance is not optional for international travel. It is essential.

Your domestic health insurance almost certainly does not cover you abroad. A hospital stay overseas can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and medical evacuation (airlifting you to a hospital or home) can exceed $100,000.

**What your policy should cover:**
- Emergency medical treatment (minimum $100,000 coverage)
- Medical evacuation and repatriation
- Trip cancellation and interruption
- Lost, stolen, or delayed baggage
- 24/7 emergency assistance hotline

**What to look for:**
- Coverage that's valid in every country you're visiting
- Pre-existing condition coverage if applicable
- Adventure sports coverage if you plan on hiking, diving, skiing, etc.
- Coverage for trip delays and missed connections

**Cost:** Expect to pay 4-8% of your total trip cost. A two-week European trip costing $3,000 might have insurance premiums around $120-240.

**Recommended providers to compare:** World Nomads, Allianz Travel, SafetyWing, IMG Global, and Genki (for digital nomads and longer trips).

## 1 Month Before Departure

The big items should be handled by now. This phase is about financial preparation, communication setup, and smart logistics.

### Notify Your Bank and Credit Cards

This is the step that most travelers either forget or underestimate.

**Why it matters:** Banks monitor for unusual activity. If your card suddenly starts getting charges from Bangkok or Buenos Aires, their fraud system may freeze it. Being stuck abroad with frozen cards and no access to money is a nightmare.

**What to do:**
- Call or use the app for every bank and credit card you'll bring
- Set a travel notice with your destination countries and travel dates
- Confirm your daily withdrawal limit and request a temporary increase if needed
- Ask about foreign transaction fees (ideally, bring a card with none)
- Get your PIN for credit cards — you may need it for chip-and-PIN terminals in Europe

**Best cards for international travel:** Look for cards that charge no foreign transaction fees. Visa and Mastercard are accepted almost everywhere. American Express has more limited acceptance outside major cities. Bring at least two cards from different networks.

**Cash strategy:**
- Order a small amount of local currency from your bank before you leave (enough for a taxi and first meal)
- Use ATMs at the destination for the best exchange rate — but only bank ATMs inside a bank, not standalone machines on the street
- Carry a backup $100-200 USD in cash for emergencies — U.S. dollars are widely accepted in emergencies worldwide

### Set Up Your Phone for International Use

Being without phone service abroad is more than inconvenient — it's a safety issue.

**Option 1: eSIM (recommended)**
Most modern smartphones support eSIM technology. You can purchase a data plan for your destination country before you leave, and it activates the moment you land. Providers like Airalo, Saily, Holafly, and Nomad offer affordable data-only plans starting at $5-15 for a week.

**Option 2: International plan from your carrier**
Most U.S. carriers offer international day passes ($5-12/day). T-Mobile includes free international data on many plans. Check with your carrier — but the eSIM route is usually cheaper.

**Option 3: Local SIM card**
Buy a prepaid SIM at the airport or a local shop. Cheapest option for longer stays but requires an unlocked phone. In some countries (like India or Indonesia), you'll need to provide passport information to purchase.

**Important:** Even with data, download offline maps for every city you're visiting. You will lose signal in metro systems, rural areas, and inside thick-walled buildings.

### Make Copies of Critical Documents

If your passport is stolen, having copies dramatically speeds up the replacement process at an embassy.

**Create copies of:**
- Passport (photo page and any visa stamps)
- Travel insurance policy and emergency number
- Flight confirmations and hotel reservations
- Credit card numbers and bank emergency phone numbers
- Vaccination records
- Driver's license

**Store them in three places:**
1. Physical copies in your luggage (separate from originals)
2. Digital copies in a secure cloud folder (Google Drive, iCloud)
3. Email them to yourself and a trusted person at home

### Register with Your Embassy

For U.S. citizens, the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) is free and takes five minutes at step.state.gov.

**What you get:**
- Safety alerts and travel advisories for your destination
- Messages about local emergencies, natural disasters, and political situations
- The embassy can contact you (or your emergency contact) in a crisis
- Assistance if you lose your passport or get into legal trouble

**For non-U.S. citizens:** Most countries have similar programs. The UK has "Travel Aware," Canada has "Registration of Canadians Abroad," and Australia has "Smartraveller."

### Research Power Adapters

Different countries use different electrical plugs. Plugging your U.S. charger into a European outlet won't work without an adapter — and could damage your device if the voltage is different.

**Quick reference by region:**
- **North America:** Type A/B (110-120V)
- **Europe (mainland):** Type C/E/F (220-240V)
- **UK, Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong:** Type G (220-240V)
- **Australia, New Zealand, China:** Type I (220-240V)
- **India:** Type D (220-240V)
- **Japan:** Type A (100V — same plug as U.S. but lower voltage)

**Good news:** Most laptop chargers, phone chargers, and camera chargers are dual voltage (check for "100-240V" on the charger label). You only need an adapter plug, not a voltage converter.

**Recommendation:** Buy a universal travel adapter with multiple plug types and built-in USB ports before your trip. They cost $15-25 and cover you anywhere in the world.

## 1 Week Before Departure

You're in the home stretch. This week is about digital preparation, final logistics, and making sure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Digital Preparation Checklist

Your phone is your most important travel tool. Prepare it properly.

**Download offline maps:**
- Google Maps: Search for your destination city, tap "Download offline map," and save the entire metro area
- Maps.me: Uses OpenStreetMap data and works well for hiking trails and rural areas
- Download maps for every city and region you'll visit, including any transit stops

**Translation apps:**
- Google Translate: Download the offline language pack for your destination's language. The camera feature translates signs and menus in real time.
- If visiting Japan, also download a Japanese keyboard to type words for searching

**Other essential downloads:**
- Your airline's app (mobile boarding passes)
- Local transit app (Citymapper for Europe, Grab for Southeast Asia, DiDi for China)
- Restaurant booking app (TheFork for Europe, Tabelog for Japan)
- Your travel insurance provider's app
- Any attraction tickets or tours you've pre-booked

**Banking apps:**
- Enable push notifications so you see charges in real time
- Confirm your travel notification is active
- Screenshot your bank's international emergency number (you may not have data when you need it)

### Share Your Itinerary

Leave a copy of your complete travel itinerary with someone you trust at home.

**What to share:**
- Flight numbers and times
- Hotel names, addresses, and confirmation numbers
- A rough day-by-day plan
- Your travel insurance policy number and emergency line
- The address and phone number of the nearest embassy or consulate

MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner generates shareable itineraries that include all of this information in one clean document — useful if you want to avoid manually compiling everything into a spreadsheet.

### Prepare Your Prescriptions

Traveling internationally with medication requires some forethought.

**Rules to follow:**
- Carry all medications in their original, labeled pharmacy containers
- Bring more than you need — pack an extra week's supply in case of delays
- Some common medications (like certain painkillers, ADHD medications, or sleep aids) are controlled or illegal in other countries. Check your destination's embassy website
- Carry a letter from your doctor listing your medications, dosages, and the conditions they treat (especially for controlled substances)
- Pack medications in your carry-on, never in checked luggage

**Consider bringing:**
- Basic first-aid supplies: bandages, antiseptic, blister pads
- Anti-diarrheal medication (traveler's stomach is real)
- Rehydration salts
- Motion sickness medication if you get carsick or seasick
- Insect repellent with DEET if traveling to tropical regions
- Sunscreen (SPF 30+)

### Handle Home Logistics

Don't leave your home situation to the last minute.

- Put your mail on hold or have someone collect it
- Arrange pet care or house sitting
- Set light timers to make it look like someone's home
- Unplug non-essential electronics
- Clean out the fridge of anything that will expire
- Check that your home insurance covers extended absences if you'll be gone more than 30 days
- Lock all windows and doors (obvious but commonly rushed)

---

## At the Airport and In-Flight

### Before Security

- Arrive at least 3 hours before international flights (some airports recommend 3.5 hours)
- Check luggage weight limits — international checked bag limits vary by airline and are usually 23 kg (50 lbs) for economy
- Remove prohibited items from carry-on: liquids over 100ml, sharp objects, lighters
- Have your passport and boarding pass ready

### At the Gate

- Listen for gate changes — they're more common on international flights
- Charge your devices at the gate (outlets are usually available)
- Buy a bottle of water after security (staying hydrated on long flights matters)
- Exchange a small amount of currency at the airport if you didn't get any beforehand (airport rates are poor, but having some cash on arrival is worth the markup)

### On the Plane

- Fill out any customs and immigration forms during the flight (crew usually distributes them 1-2 hours before landing)
- Set your watch to the destination time zone and start adjusting your sleep schedule
- Drink water regularly and avoid excessive alcohol (dehydration worsens jet lag)
- Walk around every few hours on flights over 6 hours to reduce DVT risk

### Upon Arrival

- Go through immigration with your passport and any required documents (visa, return ticket proof, hotel booking)
- Collect checked luggage and go through customs
- Activate your eSIM data or connect to airport Wi-Fi
- Withdraw local currency from a bank ATM in the arrivals hall (not currency exchange desks)
- Use official taxi stands or pre-booked ride services. Never accept rides from people approaching you in the arrivals hall.

## Safety Tips for International Travelers

### Before You Go

- Research common scams at your destination. Every tourist city has its classics: the "free" bracelet, the fake petition, the taxi with a "broken" meter, the stranger who spills something on you while an accomplice pickpockets you.
- Check government travel advisories (travel.state.gov for U.S. citizens) for security updates.
- Make note of the nearest hospital and embassy/consulate at your destination.

### While You're There

- Keep your passport in the hotel safe. Carry a photocopy and a photo on your phone for daily use.
- Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded tourist areas, markets, and public transport.
- Don't carry all your cash and cards in one place. Split them between your wallet, a money belt, and your hotel safe.
- Use ATMs inside banks during business hours when possible.
- Be skeptical of unsolicited help from strangers, especially around tourist attractions and train stations.
- Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong, leave.

### Emergency Preparation

- Save the local emergency number (it's not always 911 — in Europe it's 112, in the UK it's 999, in Japan it's 110/119)
- Know your travel insurance's emergency hotline by heart or have it saved offline
- Keep your embassy's emergency contact number accessible
- Learn a few critical phrases in the local language: "Help," "Hospital," "Police," "I need a doctor"

## First-Time International Traveler Tips

If this is your very first trip abroad, here are the things that catch people off guard:

1. **Your phone number won't work for calls/texts** unless you have an international plan or eSIM. Set up WhatsApp or similar messaging apps before you leave — they work on Wi-Fi and data anywhere.

2. **Jet lag is real.** For every time zone you cross, expect about one day of adjustment. Flying east is harder than flying west. Try to get on local time immediately: stay awake until a reasonable local bedtime, get sunlight, and avoid napping.

3. **Tipping norms vary wildly.** In the U.S., tipping 20% is standard. In Japan, it's considered rude. In Europe, service charges are often included but rounding up is appreciated. In Southeast Asia, tipping is appreciated but not expected. Research your destination's norms.

4. **Outlets look different everywhere.** Don't wait until you arrive to discover your phone charger won't fit. Buy an adapter before your trip.

5. **Water isn't always safe to drink.** In most of Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, tap water is safe. In much of Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America, stick to bottled water. When in doubt, bottled.

6. **Your credit card might get declined.** Even with a travel notification, some smaller merchants abroad have issues with international cards. Always have a backup card and some local cash.

7. **You don't need to plan every minute.** Some of the best travel experiences are unplanned. Build buffer time into your schedule for wandering, getting lost, and discovering things you didn't know existed. MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner builds flexible itineraries with free time blocks specifically for this reason — structured enough to be useful, loose enough to feel like an adventure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How far in advance should I start preparing for an international trip?

Start at least three months before departure for any trip that requires a visa or vaccinations. For trips to visa-free destinations where you already have a valid passport, one month is sufficient — but earlier is always better. Passport renewals alone can take 10-13 weeks, so check yours immediately after booking.

### Do I need travel insurance for international travel?

While it's technically not always legally required, traveling internationally without insurance is genuinely risky. Your domestic health insurance almost certainly won't cover you abroad, and a medical emergency overseas can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Medical evacuation alone can exceed $100,000. Travel insurance for a two-week trip typically costs $120-240 — a tiny fraction of the potential costs without it.

### What's the best way to handle money abroad?

Use a no-foreign-transaction-fee credit card for most purchases, and withdraw local currency from bank-owned ATMs as needed. Avoid airport currency exchange desks (their rates are poor) and standalone street ATMs (higher risk of skimmers). Carry two cards from different banks in case one gets frozen or lost, plus emergency cash in USD. Notify your banks of your travel plans before you leave.

### Should I buy a local SIM card or use an eSIM?

For most travelers in 2026, an eSIM is the better choice. You can set it up before you leave home, it activates the moment you land, and you don't need to find a store or swap physical SIM cards. Providers like Airalo and Saily offer plans starting around $5-15 per week. Local SIMs are cheaper for longer stays (30+ days) but require an unlocked phone and sometimes passport verification. Either way, download offline maps before you leave — they work without any data connection.

### What should I do if I lose my passport abroad?

Stay calm and follow these steps: (1) Report the loss to local police and get a police report, (2) Contact your country's nearest embassy or consulate — this is where STEP registration helps, as they already know you're in the country, (3) Bring your passport copy (this is why you made copies) and a passport photo to the embassy, (4) They will issue an emergency travel document that lets you return home. Having digital copies in the cloud and with a contact at home makes this process significantly faster.
