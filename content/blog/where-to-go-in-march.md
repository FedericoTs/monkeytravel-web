# Where to Go in March 2026: 12 Best Destinations for Every Type of Traveler

March is one of the most underrated months to travel. Winter is loosening its grip across the Northern Hemisphere, shoulder-season pricing kicks in across Europe and parts of Asia, and you can dodge the spring break crowds entirely if you time it right. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere is winding down from summer with warm days and thinning tourist numbers.

The challenge is narrowing it down. March weather is wildly inconsistent depending on where you go — Tokyo can be 8°C one week and 20°C the next, Iceland is a coin flip between snowstorms and clear aurora-watching skies, and Southeast Asia is entering its hottest stretch before the monsoons arrive.

We evaluated 12 destinations across four categories — beach, city, cultural, and adventure — based on what actually matters when you are choosing where to go in March: realistic weather data, daily costs that include accommodation and food, crowd levels, and specific events or conditions that make March the right month to visit.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Destination | Avg Temp | Budget/Day | Crowd Level | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bali, Indonesia | 27-30°C (81-86°F) | $40-80 | Low | Budget beach, surfing |

| Cancun, Mexico | 26-30°C (79-86°F) | $80-150 | High | Beach, nightlife |
| Tokyo, Japan | 10-17°C (50-63°F) | $80-130 | Medium-High | Cherry blossoms |
| Lisbon, Portugal | 11-18°C (52-64°F) | $60-100 | Low | City break, food |
| Rome, Italy | 6-16°C (43-61°F) | $80-130 | Low-Medium | History, off-peak |
| Barcelona, Spain | 9-16°C (48-61°F) | $70-120 | Low | Architecture, food |
| Marrakech, Morocco | 11-24°C (52-75°F) | $40-70 | Low-Medium | Culture, souks |
| Istanbul, Turkey | 5-12°C (41-54°F) | $40-70 | Low | History, food, value |
| Iceland | -2-4°C (28-39°F) | $120-200 | Low | Northern lights |
| New Zealand | 14-22°C (57-72°F) | $90-150 | Medium | Hiking, autumn |
| India (Rajasthan) | 18-32°C (64-90°F) | $25-60 | Medium | Holi, palaces |

## Beach Destinations

Warm water, reliable sunshine, and the kind of prices that let you stay a few days longer than planned.

### 1. Bali, Indonesia

**Why March:** March sits at the tail end of Bali's wet season, which scares off most tourists — but here is the reality: rain usually comes in short, intense afternoon bursts that clear within an hour. Mornings are almost always sunny, and you get the lushest, greenest version of the island. Hotel prices drop 30-40% compared to the July-August peak, and you will have surf breaks and rice terraces practically to yourself.

**Avg temp:** 27-30°C (81-86°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-80/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** Budget travelers, surfers, couples

The shoulder-season pricing in March is the real draw. A private villa in Ubud that runs $200/night in August goes for $90-120 in March. Warungs (local eateries) serve nasi goreng for $2-3, and a Balinese massage costs $8-12. The surf is excellent at Uluwatu and Padang Padang — March swells hit the west coast consistently.

**What to do:** Explore Ubud's Tegallalang rice terraces at sunrise before the tour buses arrive. Take a day trip to Nusa Penida for Kelingking Beach. Book a cooking class in Seminyak for $25-35 per person.

**Insider tip:** Skip Kuta entirely. Stay in Canggu for the surf-and-café scene, or Sidemen in east Bali for rice-terrace views without the Ubud crowds. Our [Bali 7-day itinerary](/blog/bali-7-day-itinerary) covers the best route for first-timers.

---

### 2. Cartagena, Colombia

**Why March:** Dry season, hot temperatures, and a Caribbean city that combines colonial architecture with some of the best street food on the continent. March falls just after the peak holiday rush (December-January) but still within the dry window, meaning fewer tourists, slightly lower hotel rates, and no rain to interrupt your exploration of the walled Old City.

**Avg temp:** 28-32°C (82-90°F)
**Daily budget:** $50-90/person
**Crowd level:** Medium
**Best for:** History lovers, foodies, couples

Cartagena's Old City (Ciudad Amurallada) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with cobblestone streets, colonial balconies dripping with bougainvillea, and plazas where you can eat fresh ceviche for $4-6. The Rosario Islands are a 45-minute boat ride away and offer snorkeling in Caribbean-clear water for $25-40 per day trip.

**What to do:** Walk the city walls at sunset. Eat at La Cevicheria or grab street-side arepas in Getsemani. Take a mud bath at Volcan de Lodo El Totumo ($5 including transport from hostels). Book a boat day to Playa Blanca or the Rosario Islands.

**Insider tip:** Stay in Getsemani instead of the Old City — it is cheaper, more local, and everything is a 10-minute walk away. Hostel dorms run $12-18/night; boutique hotels are $60-90.

---

### 3. Cancun, Mexico

**Why March:** Peak dry season with virtually no rain, water temperatures around 26°C (79°F), and 9-10 hours of daily sunshine. The catch: March is spring break season, so prices and crowds spike mid-month. Travel in the first or last week of March for 20-30% savings and considerably fewer crowds.

**Avg temp:** 26-30°C (79-86°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-150/person
**Crowd level:** High (mid-March), Medium (early/late March)
**Best for:** Beach lovers, nightlife, resort-style trips

Beyond the hotel zone, there is actual substance to the Yucatan. Chichen Itza is a 2.5-hour drive. The cenotes (natural sinkholes) near Valladolid and Tulum offer otherworldly swimming experiences for $5-15 entrance fees. Isla Mujeres, a 20-minute ferry from Cancun ($14 round trip), has quieter beaches and excellent snorkeling.

**What to do:** Snorkel in Cenote Ik Kil or Cenote Suytun. Day trip to Tulum ruins. Take the ferry to Isla Mujeres for a mellower beach day. Visit Chichen Itza at opening time (8 AM) to beat the tour buses.

**Insider tip:** Book accommodations in Puerto Morelos or Playa del Carmen instead of Cancun's Hotel Zone. You will save 40-50% and get a more authentic experience, with easy access to the same beaches and cenotes.

---

## City Destinations

Spring is creeping into the Northern Hemisphere's greatest cities, and the crowds have not shown up yet.

### 4. Tokyo, Japan

**Why March:** Two words: cherry blossoms. The 2026 forecast from the Japan Meteorological Corporation predicts first bloom in Tokyo around March 21, with full bloom (mankai) expected by March 28. This narrow 5-7 day window of peak bloom is one of the most visually stunning natural events on Earth, and late March puts you right in the middle of it.

**Avg temp:** 10-17°C (50-63°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-130/person
**Crowd level:** Medium-High (late March)
**Best for:** Culture seekers, photographers, food lovers

Tokyo during sakura season is genuinely special. Ueno Park, Shinjuku Gyoen, and Chidorigafuchi along the Imperial Palace moat are the prime viewing spots. But the magic is in the smaller moments — petals drifting through a quiet neighborhood shrine, a beer under the blossoms in Yoyogi Park, or a nighttime illumination at Meguro River.

**What to do:** Hanami (blossom viewing) in Shinjuku Gyoen ($5 entry). Walk the Meguro River at night during sakura illumination. Eat at Tsukiji Outer Market. Day trip to Kamakura for seaside temple visits.

**Insider tip:** Book accommodation by January — Tokyo fills up fast for cherry blossom season and prices spike 50-80% for the last two weeks of March. Consider staying in Asakusa or Ikebukuro instead of Shinjuku for 30% lower hotel rates. Check out our [Tokyo 4-day itinerary](/blog/tokyo-4-day-itinerary) and our full [cherry blossom season guide](/blog/japan-cherry-blossom-season-guide) for detailed planning.

### 5. Lisbon, Portugal

**Why March:** The best-kept secret in European spring travel. March in Lisbon means 18°C (64°F) afternoon highs, empty miradouros (viewpoints), and pastel de nata without a 20-minute queue at Pasteis de Belem. Hotel prices are 40-50% lower than summer, and flights from major European cities routinely go under $60 round trip with budget airlines.

**Avg temp:** 11-18°C (52-64°F)
**Daily budget:** $60-100/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** Solo travelers, couples, foodies

Lisbon in March feels like a local secret. Alfama's narrow streets are quiet enough to hear fado drifting from a window. The Tram 28 route, which is standing-room-only in summer, actually has seats. You can walk from Belem Tower to the MAAT museum along the waterfront without dodging selfie sticks.

**What to do:** Explore Alfama and Graca neighborhoods on foot. Take a day trip to Sintra ($5 by train) for fairy-tale palaces. Eat grilled sardines and drink vinho verde in the Bairro Alto. Visit LX Factory for indie shops and food stalls.

**Insider tip:** Get the Lisboa Card (24h for about $22) — it covers unlimited public transport plus free entry to 30+ museums and attractions, including the Jeronimos Monastery and Belem Tower. Our [Lisbon 3-day itinerary](/blog/lisbon-3-day-itinerary) maps out the perfect route.

---

### 6. Rome, Italy

**Why March:** The Eternal City before the eternal crowds. March is shoulder season in Rome — the Colosseum, Vatican Museums, and Trevi Fountain are all visitable without the 2-3 hour lines that plague summer. Temperatures are mild enough for all-day walking (12-16°C / 54-61°F), and trattorias in Trastevere have empty tables at dinner.

**Avg temp:** 6-16°C (43-61°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-130/person
**Crowd level:** Low-Medium
**Best for:** History buffs, food lovers, first-time Europe visitors

The Italians have a saying about March: "Marzo pazzerello, esce il sole prendi l'ombrello" — crazy March, the sun comes out, grab the umbrella. Weather can shift quickly, so pack layers. But the shoulder-season payoff is enormous: Vatican tickets are available same-day, restaurant reservations are unnecessary, and you can stand alone in front of the Pantheon's oculus watching rain fall through the opening.

**What to do:** Book Vatican Museums for a Friday evening opening (April-October, but check March availability). Explore Trastevere for dinner — Da Enzo al 29 is legendary. Walk the Appian Way on a quiet morning. Visit the Borghese Gallery (reservations required but easy to get in March).

**Insider tip:** March 8 is International Women's Day (Festa della Donna) — Italian cities celebrate with mimosa flowers, special events, and some museums offer free entry for women. For detailed day-by-day planning, read our [5-day Italy itinerary](/blog/5-day-italy-itinerary) or our [Paris vs Rome](/blog/paris-vs-rome) comparison if you are deciding between the two.

### 7. Barcelona, Spain

**Why March:** Barcelona in March hits the sweet spot between winter chill and summer madness. Average highs sit around 16°C (61°F) with increasing sunshine, and the city's outdoor terraces start reopening. Tourist numbers are a fraction of the summer peak, which means you can actually appreciate Gaudi's architecture without being herded through like cattle.

**Avg temp:** 9-16°C (48-61°F)
**Daily budget:** $70-120/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** Architecture fans, city explorers, couples

La Sagrada Familia tickets in March are available for same-day or next-day purchase — try that in August. Park Guell is peaceful enough to sit and sketch. The Born neighborhood's tapas bars are lively without the waiting lines. And the beaches at Barceloneta, while too cold for swimming (water is 14°C / 57°F), are perfect for morning runs and sunset walks.

**What to do:** Visit La Sagrada Familia (book the Nativity Tower for the best views). Explore the Gothic Quarter's medieval streets. Eat pintxos at Bar del Pla. Take the funicular up to Montjuic for panoramic city views.

**Insider tip:** Get the T-Casual transport card (10 trips for about $12). Barcelona's metro system covers everything, and you will use it constantly. See our [Barcelona 3-day itinerary](/blog/barcelona-3-day-itinerary) for a full route.

## Cultural Destinations

Destinations where the culture, history, or a specific March event is the main reason to go.

### 8. Marrakech, Morocco

**Why March:** The Goldilocks month for Marrakech. Summer temperatures in the medina can hit 40°C+ (104°F+), making sightseeing miserable. March offers comfortable 22-24°C (72-75°F) highs with 8 hours of sunshine — perfect for getting lost in the souks, exploring the Jardin Majorelle, and taking day trips to the Atlas Mountains without melting.

**Avg temp:** 11-24°C (52-75°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-70/person
**Crowd level:** Low-Medium
**Best for:** Culture seekers, budget travelers, photographers

Marrakech is one of the best-value destinations on this list. A traditional riad in the medina costs $30-60/night, a tagine lunch is $4-6, and a guided tour of the souks runs $15-25. The sensory overload of Jemaa el-Fnaa square at dusk — snake charmers, food stalls, storytellers, musicians — is one of travel's great free shows.

**What to do:** Wander the souks (start at Souk Semmarine and get deliberately lost). Visit Ben Youssef Madrasa and the Bahia Palace. Day trip to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains (1-hour drive, $30-50 for a guided group trip). Book a hammam experience ($15-30).

**Insider tip:** Negotiate everything in the souks — start at 50% of the asking price and work from there. Friday afternoons are quieter as many shops close for prayers, making it the best time to photograph the medina's architecture without crowds.

---

### 9. Istanbul, Turkey

**Why March:** Istanbul in March is crisp, atmospheric, and dramatically uncrowded. The Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque receive a fraction of their summer visitors. The Grand Bazaar's merchants have time to actually talk to you instead of rushing through sales. And with the Turkish lira remaining favorable for foreign visitors, Istanbul delivers an outsized experience for the money.

**Avg temp:** 5-12°C (41-54°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-70/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** History buffs, foodies, budget travelers

Istanbul straddles two continents, and March is the month to explore both sides without exhaustion. The European side (Sultanahmet, Beyoglu, Karakoy) has the monuments and the nightlife. The Asian side (Kadikoy, Moda) has the local food scene and waterfront cafes. A ferry between the two costs $0.50 and crosses the Bosphorus in 20 minutes — arguably the best half-dollar you can spend in travel.

**What to do:** Visit Hagia Sophia (free entry) and the Blue Mosque. Get lost in the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar. Take a Bosphorus ferry. Eat a balik ekmek (fish sandwich) at Eminonu. Explore Kadikoy's food market on the Asian side.

**Insider tip:** Get an Istanbulkart transport card at any metro station ($3 deposit + top-up). It works on metro, trams, buses, and ferries, and gives discounted fares. Read our [Istanbul 3-day itinerary](/blog/istanbul-3-day-itinerary) for a neighborhood-by-neighborhood plan.

### 10. India (Rajasthan) — Holi Festival

**Why March:** Holi, India's most spectacular festival, falls on March 3-4, 2026. The "festival of colors" celebrates the arrival of spring, and Rajasthan's cities — Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur — are some of the best places to experience it. Beyond Holi, March offers warm days, clear skies, and the tail end of peak tourist season, meaning slightly lower prices than January-February.

**Avg temp:** 18-32°C (64-90°F)
**Daily budget:** $25-60/person
**Crowd level:** Medium (higher during Holi)
**Best for:** Festival seekers, culture lovers, photographers

Rajasthan is arguably the most visually rich region in the world to photograph. Jaipur's pink-hued City Palace, Jodhpur's blue-painted old town, Udaipur's lake palaces, and the golden sandstone of Jaisalmer fort — March light enhances all of it.

**What to do:** Celebrate Holi in Jaipur or Udaipur (organized events at hotels are safest for tourists, $15-30). Explore Amber Fort in Jaipur. Sunrise over Jodhpur from Mehrangarh Fort. Camel safari from Jaisalmer into the Thar Desert ($30-50 for overnight).

**Insider tip:** During Holi, wear clothes you do not mind ruining — they will be drenched in colored powder. Protect your phone with a waterproof case. Book Holi-specific events through your hotel rather than wandering into street celebrations, which can be overwhelming for first-time visitors.

---

## Adventure Destinations

For travelers who want something more active, remote, or flat-out extraordinary.

### 11. Iceland — Northern Lights

**Why March:** March is the last reliable month for northern lights viewing before lengthening spring days wash out the aurora. But here is what makes March 2026 special: Solar Cycle 25, which peaked around 2025, continues to produce elevated solar activity into 2026, meaning stronger and more frequent auroral displays. You also get 12-13 hours of daylight for daytime sightseeing — a huge advantage over the dark December-January window.

**Avg temp:** -2 to 4°C (28-39°F)
**Daily budget:** $120-200/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** Adventure seekers, photographers, nature lovers

Iceland in March is a landscape of contrasts: glaciers next to geothermal hot springs, volcanic black sand beaches under snow-covered mountains, and the northern lights dancing over it all if the skies cooperate. The Golden Circle (Thingvellir, Geysir, Gullfoss) is doable as a day trip from Reykjavik, and ice cave tours in Vatnajokull are still running in early March.

**What to do:** Chase the northern lights (best chances between 10 PM and 2 AM, away from Reykjavik's light pollution). Drive the Golden Circle. Visit the Reykjadalur hot spring river (free, 45-minute hike). Explore the black sand beach at Vik.

**Insider tip:** March is one of the cheapest months to visit Iceland — accommodation is 30-40% less than summer, and you can still do most activities. Rent a car for the most flexibility ($40-60/day for a basic SUV). Check the Icelandic Met Office aurora forecast (en.vedur.is) daily. For more viewing tips, see our [best places to see the northern lights](/blog/best-places-to-see-northern-lights) guide.

---

### 12. New Zealand — Autumn Begins

**Why March:** The Southern Hemisphere's autumn kicks off in March with warm days (18-22°C / 64-72°F), cooling nights, and the first hints of golden foliage across the South Island. The summer tourist rush fades out after mid-March, and the famous Great Walks (Milford Track, Routeburn Track) become less crowded while conditions remain excellent for hiking.

**Avg temp:** 14-22°C (57-72°F)
**Daily budget:** $90-150/person
**Crowd level:** Medium (decreasing)
**Best for:** Hikers, road-trippers, nature lovers

New Zealand's landscapes need no introduction — the Southern Alps, Milford Sound, the volcanic plateau of Tongariro — but timing your visit for March means experiencing them at their most comfortable. The summer heat has broken, the water is still warm enough for kayaking, and the trails are in prime condition without the January crowds.

**What to do:** Hike the Tongariro Alpine Crossing (one of the world's best day hikes). Take a scenic flight over Milford Sound. Drive the South Island from Queenstown to Wanaka. Wine tasting in Marlborough — the sauvignon blanc harvest happens in March.

**Insider tip:** Book Great Walk hut passes well in advance through the DOC (Department of Conservation) website — they are cheaper than private alternatives and put you right on the trail. The Kepler Track near Te Anau is less famous than the Milford Track but equally spectacular and easier to book.

## FAQ

### What is the cheapest destination to visit in March?

Istanbul and Marrakech consistently offer the best value for March travel, with realistic daily budgets of $40-70 per person including mid-range accommodation, meals, and activities. Bali is similarly affordable at $40-80/day, though flight costs from Europe or North America are higher. India (Rajasthan) can be done for as little as $25-40/day if you stay in budget guesthouses and eat local food.

### Is March a good time to visit Europe?

March is excellent for European city breaks if you prioritize culture over beach weather. Cities like [Lisbon](/destinations/lisbon), [Rome](/destinations/rome), and [Barcelona](/destinations/barcelona) offer mild temperatures (12-18°C / 54-64°F), significantly lower prices than summer, and far fewer tourists. You will not be swimming, but you will have museums, restaurants, and historic sites largely to yourself. It is arguably the smartest time to visit these cities if you do not need scorching heat.

### When should I book flights for March travel?

For the best prices, book 6-10 weeks ahead for short-haul flights and 3-4 months ahead for long-haul routes. March has a price spike during the second and third weeks due to spring break demand (especially for Caribbean and Mexico destinations), so if flexibility allows, target the first or last week of March. Use [MonkeyTravel's AI planner](/) to compare destination costs side by side and find the best fit for your budget.

### Can I see cherry blossoms in Tokyo in March?

Yes, but timing is critical. The 2026 forecast predicts first bloom in Tokyo around March 21, with full bloom by March 28. The peak viewing window (mankai) lasts only 5-7 days. If you are specifically traveling for cherry blossoms, target March 25-31 for the best chance of catching full bloom in Tokyo. Kyoto follows about 4 days later (full bloom around April 2). See our [complete cherry blossom season guide](/blog/japan-cherry-blossom-season-guide) for detailed planning.

### What should I pack for a March trip?

It depends entirely on the destination. For tropical spots (Bali, Cartagena, Cancun), pack light breathable clothing, sunscreen, and a light rain jacket. For European cities (Lisbon, Rome, Barcelona), bring layers — mornings and evenings are cool (8-12°C / 46-54°F) even when afternoons are pleasant. For Iceland, you need proper cold-weather gear: thermal base layers, a windproof outer shell, waterproof boots, and gloves. For all destinations, a packable daypack and comfortable walking shoes are non-negotiable.
