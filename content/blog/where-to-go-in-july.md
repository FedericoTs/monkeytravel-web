# Where to Go in July 2026: 12 Best Destinations for Peak Summer Travel

July is the month the travel world runs at full throttle. Schools are out across Europe and North America, airline routes hit maximum capacity, and the Northern Hemisphere bakes under long, sun-drenched days. It is, statistically, the most popular month for international travel — and that means peak pricing, peak crowds, and peak competition for the best hotels and experiences.

But peak season is not a reason to stay home. It is a reason to plan smarter. Some destinations genuinely hit their best form in July: perfect weather windows, festivals that only happen once a year, and natural phenomena tied to this exact month. Others should be avoided entirely — oppressive heat, unbearable crowds, or monsoon downpours that will ruin your trip.

We selected 12 destinations across five continents that specifically reward July travel. For each one, you get real weather data, honest daily budgets (accommodation, food, transport, and one activity per day — flights excluded since they vary by origin), crowd assessments, and the July-specific events or conditions that justify booking during the most expensive month of the year.

## Beach & Coastal Destinations

July in the Mediterranean means blazing sunshine, warm seas, and packed coastlines. The trick is choosing destinations where the heat and crowds are manageable — or embracing them at spots where the infrastructure can handle the volume.

### 1. Croatia (Dubrovnik & Split)

**Why July:** The Adriatic Sea hits 25°C in July — its warmest — and the Croatian coast is at its most vibrant. The Dubrovnik Summer Festival runs from July 10 to August 25, turning the medieval Old Town into an open-air stage for theater, opera, and classical music performances in venues like Fort Lovrijenac and the Rector's Palace. Split hosts Ultra Europe (July 10-12), one of the continent's biggest electronic music festivals. And beyond the cities, over a thousand islands offer quiet escapes from the mainland crowds.

**Weather:** Highs of 29°C (84°F), lows of 22°C (72°F). Up to 14 hours of sunshine daily. Virtually no rain — July averages just 24mm across 3-4 brief showers.

**What to do:** Walk Dubrovnik's city walls at 8 AM before cruise ships unload ($35, 90 minutes). Ferry to Hvar for lavender fields and nightlife (2 hours from Split, $20 each way). Kayak around Lokrum Island. Day-trip to Mljet National Park for saltwater lakes and forested trails. Catch Ultra Europe in Split's Poljud Stadium, then recover at Bacvice Beach.

**Daily budget:** $110-180 per person. Croatia is still more affordable than Italy or Greece for comparable Mediterranean quality. A seafood dinner in a local konoba runs $20-30 per person. Apartment rentals outside the Old Towns start at $70/night in July. Ferries between islands cost $10-25.

**Insider tip:** Dubrovnik's Old Town is essentially unvisitable between 10 AM and 5 PM when cruise ships are docked — up to 4 ships per day in July. Plan your Old Town exploration for early morning or evening. Spend midday on Lokrum or at the beaches east of Lapad.

---

### 2. Algarve, Portugal

**Why July:** Portugal's southern coast delivers the most reliable beach weather in Western Europe. The Algarve gets an average of 12 hours of sunshine per day in July with virtually zero rain, and the Atlantic keeps temperatures more bearable than the scorching interior. The dramatic sandstone cliffs, sea caves, and hidden coves along the coast are at their most photogenic under the high summer sun.

**Weather:** Highs of 29°C (84°F), lows of 20°C (68°F). The Atlantic is cooler than the Mediterranean at 21°C — refreshing rather than bathwater. Less than 2mm of rain for the entire month.

**What to do:** Kayak into the Benagil Sea Cave (only accessible by water, $25-35 for a guided tour). Cliff-walk the Seven Hanging Valleys trail from Carvoeiro to Benagil — 6km of the most dramatic coastal scenery in Europe. Surf at Sagres, the southwestern tip of mainland Europe. Day-trip to the hilltop town of Silves for its Moorish castle and medieval festival (late July). Eat grilled sardines and cataplana seafood stew in Lagos.

**Daily budget:** $100-160 per person. The Algarve is significantly cheaper than the French Riviera or Amalfi Coast. A beachside grilled fish lunch runs $12-18. Apartment rentals in Lagos or Tavira start at $60/night. A beer costs $2-3.

**Insider tip:** Skip the overcrowded Benagil Cave boat tours and rent a kayak instead ($15/hour). You can paddle in at your own pace and actually enter the cave, which the larger boats cannot. Go before 10 AM when the light inside the cave is best.

If you're exploring [Lisbon](/destinations/lisbon) as your base, the Algarve is a 2.5-hour train ride south — an easy extension to any Portugal trip.

---

### 3. Santorini, Greece

**Why July:** This is Santorini at its most quintessential — blazing sunshine, whitewashed villages glowing against the deep blue Aegean, and caldera sunsets that look exactly like the postcards. The sea temperature reaches 25°C, perfect for swimming. July is peak season at its peak, which means the island is crowded and expensive — but if you have always wanted the iconic Santorini experience, this is the month that delivers it in full.

**Weather:** Highs of 29°C (84°F), lows of 23°C (73°F). Zero rainfall. Thirteen hours of daily sunshine. The meltemi wind picks up in July, which actually helps moderate the heat and creates excellent sailing conditions.

**What to do:** Watch the sunset from the Akrotiri Lighthouse rather than Oia (same view, a fraction of the crowd). Explore the ancient Minoan ruins at Akrotiri — a 3,600-year-old city buried in volcanic ash. Sail the caldera with a catamaran cruise to the volcanic hot springs ($90-130 with dinner). Swim at Red Beach and the black sand beaches of Perissa. Wine-taste at Santo Wines or Venetsanos for volcanic varietals you will not find anywhere else.

**Daily budget:** $170-280 per person. July is the most expensive month. Stay in Perissa or Kamari ($80-120/night) rather than Oia or Fira ($200-400+) for 50-60% savings. A taverna meal costs $18-30; a caldera-view restaurant runs $50-80. Book 6-9 months ahead for the best rates.

**Insider tip:** Rent an ATV ($25-40/day) instead of relying on taxis or buses. The island is small enough to cross in 30 minutes, and ATVs give you freedom to stop at viewpoints and beaches that group tours skip.

---

### 4. Barcelona, Spain

**Why July:** [Barcelona](/destinations/barcelona) in July is a nonstop festival of sun, culture, and nightlife. Beach season is in full swing with 14+ hours of daylight and water temperatures of 25°C. The Grec Festival — Barcelona's premier performing arts event — runs throughout July with theater, dance, music, and circus across venues citywide. And unlike August (when locals flee and many restaurants close for vacation), July Barcelona is fully alive.

**Weather:** Highs of 29°C (84°F), lows of 22°C (72°F). Very little rain — maybe 2-3 brief thunderstorms all month. Humidity is moderate, less oppressive than Rome or Athens.

**What to do:** Swim at Barceloneta Beach before 10 AM when it's still manageable. Visit Gaudi's Sagrada Familia and Park Guell (book timed tickets months ahead). Attend Grec Festival shows in outdoor amphitheaters. Explore the Gothic Quarter at dusk when the heat breaks. Take a day trip to Montserrat for the mountain monastery and hiking.

**Daily budget:** $130-200 per person. July accommodation is at peak pricing — expect $120-180/night for a decent Eixample hotel. But daily life remains affordable: a menu del dia lunch is $14-18, metro rides are $1.40, and a cafia (small beer) costs $2-3.

**Insider tip:** Skip La Boqueria market (overrun with tourists, inflated prices). Walk 15 minutes to Mercat de Sant Antoni — reopened after a gorgeous renovation — where locals actually shop. Better food, half the price, zero selfie sticks.

Use MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner to build a Barcelona itinerary that balances beach days, Gaudi visits, and Grec Festival shows without the scheduling headaches of peak July.

## Mountain & Cool Escapes

When Mediterranean cities hit 35°C+ and crowds reach critical mass, mountains offer a literal breath of fresh air. July is the prime month for alpine hiking, with snow cleared from high passes and wildflowers in full bloom.

### 5. Swiss Alps

**Why July:** This is the single best month for hiking in Switzerland. The highest mountain passes and trails are finally snow-free, Alpine meadows explode with wildflowers, and temperatures at altitude are a refreshing 15-22°C while the rest of Europe swelters. Cable cars and mountain railways run at full capacity, opening access to viewpoints and trails that are locked down by snow for eight months of the year.

**Weather:** Varies dramatically by altitude. Valley towns like Interlaken see highs of 25°C (77°F). At 2,000m+ (where you'll hike), expect 15-20°C (59-68°F). Afternoon thunderstorms are common — start hikes early and carry rain gear. Mornings are typically clear and spectacular.

**What to do:** Hike the Eiger Trail with views of the North Face (2.5 hours, moderate). Ride the Jungfraujoch railway to the "Top of Europe" at 3,454m ($220, but unforgettable on a clear day). Walk through the Lauterbrunnen Valley — 72 waterfalls cascading from vertical cliffs. Take the Schilthorn cable car for the revolving restaurant with 360-degree panoramas. Swim in the pristine lakes around Lucerne and Thun.

**Daily budget:** $200-320 per person. Switzerland is expensive — there is no budget hack around this. A mountain hotel runs $150-250/night. Restaurant meals cost $25-45. Cable car rides are $30-80 each. The Swiss Travel Pass ($240 for 3 days) covers trains, boats, and some cable cars, and is essential for controlling costs.

**Insider tip:** Stay in Wengen or Murren (car-free villages above Lauterbrunnen) rather than Interlaken. Same access to hikes and views, smaller crowds, and 20-30% cheaper accommodation. Both are reached by mountain railway included in the Swiss Travel Pass.

---

### 6. Canadian Rockies (Banff & Jasper)

**Why July:** The Canadian Rockies hit their brief but glorious prime in July. Snow melts from the highest trails, the turquoise glacial lakes reach peak color (the milky blue-green comes from rock flour suspended in snowmelt), and wildlife — bears, elk, mountain goats — is active and visible in the valleys and alpine meadows. The Icefields Parkway between Banff and Jasper (230km) is widely considered one of the most scenic drives on Earth, and July is the one month when every viewpoint, trailhead, and campsite along it is fully accessible.

**Weather:** Highs of 22°C (72°F), lows of 7°C (45°F). Long days with sunset after 9:30 PM. Afternoon thunderstorms are common but brief. Mountain weather is unpredictable — pack layers and rain gear regardless.

**What to do:** Hike to the Plain of Six Glaciers from Lake Louise (5.3km each way, moderate). Drive the Icefields Parkway with stops at Peyto Lake, the Columbia Icefield, and Athabasca Falls. Canoe on Moraine Lake at sunrise (arrive by 6 AM — the parking lot fills by 7). Soak in the Banff Upper Hot Springs. Spot grizzly bears along the Bow Valley Parkway.

**Daily budget:** $150-250 per person. July is peak season and accommodation prices reflect it — hotels in Banff town start at $200/night. Campsites ($25-40/night, book months ahead via Parks Canada) are the budget option. Restaurant meals run $20-35. Park entry is $11 CAD/day or $73 for an annual Discovery Pass.

**Insider tip:** Moraine Lake and Lake Louise are so popular in July that Parks Canada restricts private vehicle access. Take the Parks Canada shuttle (free with reservation, book early) or arrive before 6 AM. Alternatively, visit Emerald Lake in Yoho National Park next door — equally stunning, a fraction of the crowds.

---

### 7. Copenhagen, Denmark

**Why July:** Copenhagen is the anti-Mediterranean summer escape. While southern Europe fries at 35°C+, Denmark offers comfortable 20-22°C days, long Scandinavian light (sunset after 10 PM in early July), and a city that is built for summer living — outdoor cafes, harbor swimming, parks, cycling, and the relaxed hygge lifestyle that feels most authentic when experienced under the Nordic summer sun. The Copenhagen Jazz Festival (July 3-12) fills 100+ venues across the city with free and ticketed concerts.

**Weather:** Highs of 21°C (70°F), lows of 13°C (55°F). About 8-10 hours of sunshine daily. Rain is possible on roughly 10 days of the month, but usually as brief showers. Pack a light jacket and an umbrella.

**What to do:** Swim at the harbor baths at Islands Brygge (free, open-air pools in the harbor). Cycle the city's 400km of bike lanes — rent a bike for $15/day or use the city bike-share. Explore the food stalls at Reffen street food market on Refshaleoen. Visit the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (30 minutes north, one of Europe's best). Wander through the free-spirited Christiania neighborhood.

**Daily budget:** $140-220 per person. Copenhagen is not cheap, but it is more affordable than Stockholm or Oslo. Hotels run $120-200/night. A smorrebroed (open sandwich) lunch costs $12-18. A craft beer is $7-10. Many of the city's best experiences — harbor swimming, cycling, parks, jazz festival outdoor concerts — are free.

**Insider tip:** Copenhagen's best meal might be the $6 hot dog from DOP, a gourmet hot dog stand near Nyhavn. The locals know it; the tourists walk past it toward overpriced Nyhavn restaurants. Also, the Copenhagen Card ($60 for 24 hours) covers 80+ attractions and all public transit — it pays for itself in one museum day.

## Cultural & Festival Destinations

July's festival calendar is stacked. From ancient theater in Provence to the greatest wildlife show on Earth in East Africa, these destinations offer experiences that are impossible to replicate any other month.

### 8. London, England

**Why July:** [London](/destinations/london) in July is the city at its most sociable. The parks are green and full of picnickers, outdoor concerts and cinema screenings pop up across the city, and the cultural calendar is extraordinary: Wimbledon (through early July), BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall (starting mid-July), Pride in London, and the Henley Royal Regatta. Daylight lasts past 9 PM, transforming the Thames riverside into a golden-hour promenade.

**Weather:** Highs of 23°C (73°F), lows of 14°C (57°F). July is London's warmest month, but don't be fooled — rain is always possible (about 13 rainy days on average). Bring layers and an umbrella alongside your summer clothes.

**What to do:** Catch the final days of Wimbledon at the All England Club (queue for ground passes from $30, or watch on the big screen at Henman Hill for free). Attend a BBC Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall ($8-60 for Proms standing tickets). Picnic in Hyde Park or Hampstead Heath. Explore the free museums — the British Museum, Tate Modern, V&A, and Natural History Museum cost nothing. Walk the South Bank from Tower Bridge to Westminster at sunset.

**Daily budget:** $150-230 per person. London is expensive but manageable if you exploit its wealth of free attractions. Hotels start at $120-180/night in Zone 2. A pub lunch costs $12-18. An Oyster card daily cap is about $10. The free museums alone justify days of entertainment.

**Insider tip:** The BBC Proms are one of the best-value cultural events in the world. Standing-room "Promming" tickets cost just $8 and give you access to world-class orchestras in one of the planet's finest concert halls. Queue 45 minutes before the performance for the Arena.

---

### 9. Masai Mara, Kenya

**Why July:** The Great Migration. Every July, roughly 1.5 million wildebeest, 500,000 zebras, and 200,000 gazelles pour across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem from Tanzania into Kenya's Masai Mara. They come for the rain-fed grasses, and predators — lions, leopards, cheetahs, crocodiles — follow. The river crossings, where thousands of animals plunge into the crocodile-infested Mara River, are among the most dramatic wildlife spectacles on Earth. This is not a generic safari. This is the single greatest wildlife event on the planet, and July is when it begins.

**Weather:** Daytime highs of 24°C (75°F), lows of 12°C (54°F). July is technically the "cool dry season," though brief showers are possible. Mornings can be chilly on game drives — bring a fleece. Clear skies and good visibility make for excellent photography conditions.

**What to do:** Game drives at dawn and dusk for migration herds and predator activity. Position yourself along the Mara River for crossing events (your guide will know the likely spots). Take a hot-air balloon safari over the migrating herds at sunrise ($450-500, book months ahead). Visit a Maasai village to learn about the semi-nomadic culture ($20-30). Night drives for nocturnal predators.

**Daily budget:** $150-350 per person, depending heavily on lodge choice. Budget camps and conservancy tents start at $150/night (all-inclusive with meals and game drives). Mid-range lodges run $250-400/night. Luxury tented camps go $500-1,000+. Park entry is $80/day for international visitors.

**Insider tip:** Stay in one of the private conservancies bordering the Mara (Ol Kinyei, Naboisho, Olare Motorogi) rather than inside the main reserve. You get the same migration herds with 90% fewer vehicles, plus the conservancies allow night drives and walking safaris that are prohibited in the national reserve.

---

### 10. Marrakech, Morocco

**Why July:** This is a contrarian pick. July in [Marrakech](/destinations/marrakech) is scorching — daytime temperatures routinely hit 37-40°C. But that extreme heat is precisely why it works for budget travelers. July and August are Marrakech's low season. Riad prices drop 40-50% from peak spring rates. The souks are quieter. Restaurant tables are available without reservations. And the city takes on a different rhythm: mornings and evenings come alive, while the blazing midday hours are spent in the shade of courtyard riads or hammams. If you can handle the heat, July Marrakech is one of the world's great travel bargains.

**Weather:** Highs of 37°C (99°F), lows of 22°C (72°F). Essentially zero rain. Intense dry heat — easier to manage than humid heat, but still demanding. UV is extreme — sunscreen and hats are mandatory.

**What to do:** Explore the Medina and souks in the morning before 11 AM. Visit the Bahia Palace and Saadian Tombs (tiled interiors offer shade and beauty). Spend midday at a hammam ($15-30 for a traditional scrub) or poolside at your riad. Return to Jemaa el-Fnaa at sunset when food stalls, musicians, and storytellers take over the square. Day-trip to the Ouzoud Waterfalls (2.5 hours, $25-40 organized tour) or the Atlas Mountains for cooler air.

**Daily budget:** $60-100 per person. July pricing makes Marrakech extraordinarily affordable. Boutique riads that cost $120/night in April drop to $50-70 in July. A tagine lunch costs $5-8. A full hammam experience is $15-30. Taxis across the Medina are $2-3.

**Insider tip:** Book a riad with a plunge pool. In July, that small pool becomes the most valuable amenity in the city. Many mid-range riads ($50-80/night) include one, and spending the 1-4 PM heat hours in cool water transforms the trip.

---

## Unique July Experiences

### 11. Iceland

**Why July:** Iceland in July is the midnight sun at its most accessible. The island receives 20-21 hours of functional daylight, and on clear evenings the sun barely dips below the horizon before rising again. Puffin colonies are at peak activity along the coasts. Highland roads (F-roads) that are impassable for 9 months of the year are finally open, granting access to the most remote and spectacular interior landscapes. Whale watching season peaks with humpbacks and minke whales in northern bays. It is the warmest month — though "warm" in Iceland still means a jacket.

**Weather:** Highs of 13°C (55°F), lows of 8°C (46°F). July is one of Iceland's driest months, averaging about 50mm of rain. But Icelandic weather changes by the hour — you can experience sunshine, rain, wind, and fog in a single afternoon. Waterproof layers are non-negotiable.

**What to do:** Drive the Ring Road (Route 1, 1,322km) — July is the only month when every section is reliably open. Visit puffin colonies at Latrabjarg, Vestmannaeyjar, or Borgarfjordur Eystri. Whale-watch from Husavik ($80-100). Hike Landmannalaugar's colorful rhyolite mountains. Soak in Seljavallalaug, a hidden hot pool in a mountain valley (free). Explore Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon with its floating icebergs.

**Daily budget:** $180-280 per person. A campervan ($120-170/day in July) is the smartest budget choice — it combines transport and accommodation. Campsites cost $15-35/night. A lamb soup lunch is $16-22. Gas is around $9.50/gallon. The Blue Lagoon runs $75-100; skip it for the free hot springs.

**Insider tip:** Book your campervan or rental car by March. July is Iceland's highest-demand month, and vehicle availability drops sharply after spring. A campervan booked in February costs 30-40% less than one booked in May.

---

### 12. Bali, Indonesia

**Why July:** July sits in the heart of [Bali's](/destinations/bali) dry season, and it is genuinely one of the best months to visit. Consistent sunshine, low humidity, clean offshore swells on the west coast, and vibrant cultural festivals make this the island's prime time. The Bali Arts Festival runs through mid-July at the Taman Werdhi Budaya art center in Denpasar, showcasing traditional dance, gamelan music, puppet theater, and craft exhibitions from across the archipelago.

**Weather:** Highs of 28°C (82°F), lows of 23°C (73°F). Very low rainfall — only 50-60mm for the month, mostly as brief late-afternoon showers. Humidity is noticeably lower than the wet season, making the heat comfortable rather than oppressive.

**What to do:** Surf Uluwatu and Padang Padang (consistent 4-6 foot swells with offshore winds). Sunrise trek up Mount Batur ($40-50 with guide and breakfast). Attend the Bali Arts Festival. Explore the Tegallalang rice terraces near Ubud. Snorkel with manta rays off Nusa Penida ($40-60 day trip with boat). Take a cooking class in Ubud ($25-35). Visit Tirta Empul temple for a Balinese purification ceremony.

**Daily budget:** $50-85 per person. Bali in July costs slightly more than shoulder months but remains an outstanding value. A villa with a private pool in Ubud starts at $35/night. Warung meals cost $2-4. A one-hour Balinese massage is $10-15. Scooter rental is $5/day.

**Insider tip:** Split your trip between two coasts. The west (Canggu, Uluwatu) gets the best surf in July with offshore winds, while the east (Amed, Tulamben) has calm waters ideal for snorkeling and diving — including the famous USAT Liberty shipwreck in Tulamben, accessible directly from shore.

## July Travel Tips: Beating Peak Season

### Book Early — Much Earlier Than You Think

July is the highest-demand month for travel globally. The data is clear: flights booked 4-6 months ahead average 25-35% less than last-minute fares. Hotels in popular destinations — Santorini, Dubrovnik, Banff, Iceland — sell out their best-value options by March. If you are reading this and haven't booked July accommodation yet, do it today.

### Embrace the Early Morning

In hot destinations (Barcelona, Marrakech, Algarve), the hours between 7-10 AM are golden. Attractions are quieter, temperatures are bearable, and the light is beautiful for photography. Plan your major sightseeing before 11 AM, retreat to pools, beaches, or air-conditioned museums during the 1-4 PM heat, and emerge for the evening passeggiata.

### Go Where the Crowds Aren't

For every overcrowded July destination, there is a less-known alternative delivering a similar experience. Instead of Santorini, try Milos or Naxos. Instead of Dubrovnik's Old Town, explore Kotor in Montenegro (30 minutes away). Instead of central Banff, drive to Kootenay or Yoho National Park. The sidebar destinations are often the better trip.

### July Festival Calendar 2026

| Date | Event | Location |
|---|---|---|
| July 2-5 | Rock Werchter | Leuven, Belgium |
| July 3-12 | Copenhagen Jazz Festival | Copenhagen, Denmark |
| July 4-25 | Festival d'Avignon | Avignon, France |
| July 10-12 | Ultra Europe | Split, Croatia |
| July 10 - Aug 25 | Dubrovnik Summer Festival | Dubrovnik, Croatia |
| July 17-19 & 24-26 | Tomorrowland | Boom, Belgium |
| July 19 | FIFA World Cup Final | New Jersey, USA |
| Mid-July onward | BBC Proms | London, England |
| Throughout July | Grec Festival | Barcelona, Spain |
| Throughout July | Bali Arts Festival | Denpasar, Bali |

### Use AI to Navigate Peak Season Complexity

Peak season means more variables: sold-out attractions, reservation-only restaurants, timed-entry tickets, festival schedules, and transit bottlenecks. Building a July itinerary that accounts for all of these moving parts is genuinely time-consuming. MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner cross-references availability, transit times, weather patterns, and crowd levels to build day-by-day plans that would take hours to research manually.

## FAQ

### Is July a good month to travel internationally?

July is the most popular month for international travel, which means the best weather in the Northern Hemisphere but also the highest prices and biggest crowds. It is an excellent month to travel if you plan ahead: book flights and hotels 4-6 months in advance, choose destinations that genuinely peak in July (rather than ones that are simply hot and crowded), and use strategies like early-morning sightseeing and alternative destinations to avoid the worst of peak-season friction.

### Where is the cheapest place to travel in July?

[Bali](/destinations/bali) offers the best value at $50-85/day, followed by [Marrakech](/destinations/marrakech) at $60-100/day — where July's extreme heat means low-season pricing on riads and restaurants. In Europe, the Algarve ($100-160/day) and Croatia ($110-180/day) deliver Mediterranean quality at below-average European costs. Avoid Santorini, the Swiss Alps, and Iceland if you're budget-conscious — all three exceed $170/day at a minimum.

### Where should I go in July to escape the heat?

Iceland (13°C), Copenhagen (21°C), the Swiss Alps (15-22°C at altitude), and the Canadian Rockies (22°C) all offer comfortable summer temperatures without the oppressive heat of southern Europe or North Africa. The Masai Mara in Kenya, at 24°C during the dry season, also provides a surprisingly mild alternative while delivering the Great Migration — one of the best wildlife experiences on the planet.

### Is July too crowded for Europe?

Parts of Europe are genuinely overwhelming in July — Santorini, [Barcelona](/destinations/barcelona), and Dubrovnik's Old Town can feel uncomfortably packed. But crowd levels vary dramatically by destination and timing. Portugal's Algarve, Copenhagen, and [London](/destinations/london) all remain manageable in July. Within crowded destinations, visiting attractions before 9 AM and after 5 PM, and exploring neighborhoods outside the tourist core, makes a significant difference.

### How far in advance should I book July travel?

For the best prices and availability, book 4-6 months in advance (January-March for July travel). Iceland campervans, Santorini hotels, Banff campsites, and Masai Mara lodges all sell out their mid-range options by spring. Festival tickets (Tomorrowland, Ultra Europe, BBC Proms) often sell out even earlier. Last-minute July bookings typically cost 30-50% more and offer significantly fewer choices.
