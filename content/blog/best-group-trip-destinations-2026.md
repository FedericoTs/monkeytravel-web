# 15 Best Group Trip Destinations in 2026 (For Every Budget and Vibe)

88% of Millennials and Gen Z say they're maintaining or increasing their travel budgets in 2026, according to Booking.com's trend report. A growing chunk of that spending is going toward group trips — friend trips, birthday weekends, post-wedding adventures.

But the destination makes or breaks a group trip more than the planning does. Pick somewhere too expensive and half the group quietly resents every restaurant choice. Pick somewhere with bad transit and you'll spend your vacation coordinating taxis.

We cross-referenced daily cost data from Budget Your Trip and Numbeo and narrowed it down to 15 destinations that actually work for groups — sorted by budget tier.

## How We Picked These Destinations

- **Group-friendly accommodation** — Villas, large Airbnbs, apart-hotels, or hostels with private rooms. Four separate hotel rooms means the group barely sees each other.
- **Activity variety** — The best group destinations let the history nerd, the foodie, the beach person, and the nightlife crew all find their thing.
- **Walkability and transit** — Coordinating 4 Ubers across a sprawling city kills the vibe. Good group destinations are compact or have cheap, reliable public transport.
- **Value for money** — Cost per person per day including accommodation (split for 4-6 people), meals, local transport, and one activity. Flights not included.

## Budget-Friendly (Under $60/Day Per Person)

These destinations prove you don't need a big budget for a great group trip.

### 1. Lisbon, Portugal (~$45/day)

A group of five can rent a full apartment in Alfama or Bairro Alto for $120-160/night — that's $25-30 per person. Meals at local tascas run $8-12 with wine. The city is compact enough to walk everywhere, and Tram 28 costs under $4.

What makes it work for groups: morning at Time Out Market for the food crowd, afternoon at Praia de Caxias for beach people, sunset at Miradouro da Graca for everyone. Sintra day trips (30 minutes by train) give culture lovers a full day without dragging the whole group along.

### 2. Split, Croatia (~$50/day)

Diocletian's Palace is right in the center — you're literally walking through a Roman ruin to get coffee. Group apartments in Varos run $100-140/night for 4-6 people.

The real selling point: island access. Ferries to Hvar and Brac leave from the city harbor. Party people head to Hvar's beach clubs, history buffs explore the fortress, and the chill crew grabs a quiet cove on Brac. Dinner back in Split costs $10-15 per person.

### 3. Mexico City, Mexico (~$35/day)

For food-obsessed groups, nothing beats CDMX. Street tacos are $1-2 each. A large Airbnb in Roma Norte or Condesa goes for $80-120/night. The metro costs $0.25 per ride.

Mornings at the Museo Nacional de Antropologia (free on Sundays), afternoons at Xochimilco's floating gardens ($5/hour for a trajinera boat), evenings at rooftop mezcalerias in Juarez. You'll struggle to spend $35/day even if you try.

### 4. Hoi An, Vietnam (~$30/day)

The ultra-budget pick that doesn't feel like a compromise. A villa with a pool runs $60-80/night — split five ways, that's resort living for hotel money. Cao lau (the local noodle specialty) is $1.50. A cooking class with market tour is $15 per person.

The town is small enough to explore on rented bicycles ($2/day). An Bang Beach is 15 minutes away. Tailors make custom suits in 24 hours for $50-100. The lantern-lit Old Town at night is where the whole group just slows down.

### 5. Budapest, Hungary (~$40/day)

Ruin bars, thermal baths, and a Danube riverfront that rivals Paris — at a third of the price. Craft beers are $2-3, cocktails $5-6. Group apartments near the Great Market Hall run $90-130/night.

Szechenyi Baths ($25/person for the full day) is the most democratic group activity possible — everyone soaks and chats. Margaret Island is free for morning runs, Buda Castle covers the sightseers, and the ruin bar crawl brings everyone back together by midnight.

## Mid-Range ($60-120/Day Per Person)

More comfort, more variety, zero guilt about the second cocktail.

### 6. Barcelona, Spain (~$80/day)

Beach, world-class architecture, $4 pintxos to Michelin stars, and nightlife that starts at midnight. A large apartment in Eixample or Gracia runs $150-200/night for five.

Book Sagrada Familia ($30/person) in advance — it's non-negotiable. Then let the group split: Barceloneta Beach, Gothic Quarter wandering, La Boqueria market. Reunite for dinner in El Born. Metro covers everything for $12/10-ride pass.

### 7. Marrakech, Morocco (~$65/day)

Renting a full riad in the Medina is one of the best group accommodation experiences on earth. For $120-180/night you get a private courtyard, rooftop terrace, and often a plunge pool. Breakfast included.

Day trips to the Atlas Mountains ($30/person) or Essaouira ($8 each way by bus) keep things interesting. Dinner in the Medina runs $8-12 for tagine. Fair warning: the souks will eat your budget if you're not careful with haggling.

### 8. Dubrovnik + Montenegro (~$90/day)

Dubrovnik alone is stunning but small — pair it with Montenegro's Bay of Kotor for a full week of Adriatic coastline. Dubrovnik apartments run $160-220/night; Kotor is cheaper at $80-120.

Rent a boat along the Elaphiti Islands ($300-400 split among 6) — easily the trip highlight. Walk Dubrovnik's city walls ($30/person), then drive 2 hours to Kotor's medieval streets. Two countries, two price points, zero repeated experiences.

### 9. Cape Town, South Africa (~$70/day)

The exchange rate makes Cape Town spectacular value. A group villa in Camps Bay with ocean views runs $150-200/night. Wine tastings in Stellenbosch are $5-10. Table Mountain cable car is $15.

Safari day trips to Aquila Reserve ($150/person), penguins at Boulders Beach ($5), surfing in Muizenberg ($25), and the Constantia wine route — all in one city. You'll want a rental car, but splitting five ways makes it negligible.

### 10. Osaka, Japan (~$85/day)

Japan's kitchen. Street food in Dotonbori means eating incredibly well for $15-20/day. A large Airbnb in Namba runs $120-160/night for 4-5 people.

Day trip to Kyoto (30 minutes, $5 each way) for temples and bamboo groves. Osaka Castle mornings, kushikatsu in Shinsekai afternoons, Dotonbori neon chaos at night. Japan's train system means nobody needs a car, and the IC card makes transit thoughtless.

## Splurge-Worthy ($120+/Day Per Person)

When the group chat says "let's do it properly."

### 11. Bali, Indonesia (~$120/day for villa life)

A private villa in Canggu with pool, staff, and breakfast runs $250-400/night — split six ways, that's $40-65 each. Spa treatments are $20-30, surf lessons $25, beachfront warung dinners $8-12.

Each area has a different vibe: Ubud for wellness (rice terraces, yoga), Uluwatu for surfers, Seminyak for nightlife. Hire a driver for $35/day for the whole car. The only real expense is getting there.

### 12. Amalfi Coast, Italy (~$150/day)

Splitting a villa in Praiano makes it accessible: $250-350/night for 4-6 people. Budget $30-40/day for meals — less if you buy lemons and mozzarella from roadside stalls.

Rent a boat from Amalfi harbor ($250-350/day split among the group) to skip traffic and find hidden coves. The Path of the Gods hike is free and spectacular. Evenings are for aperitivo with limoncello in Ravello. Book months ahead — this stretch fills fast.

### 13. Tulum, Mexico (~$130/day)

Boutique rental houses in the beach zone run $200-300/night for a group. The cenotes are the must-do: Gran Cenote ($12/person) and Dos Ojos ($20/person) are surreal swimming holes surrounded by jungle.

Tulum Ruins ($5/person, arrive at 8 AM), cenotes in the afternoon, beach clubs in the evening. Day trip to Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve ($80/person) for mangroves, dolphins, and zero cell service.

### 14. Greek Islands (~$140/day)

Island-hopping is the ultimate group trip format. The classic route — Athens, Naxos, Paros, Santorini — works on a 10-day trip. Ferries cost $25-50 per person.

Group villas on Naxos and Paros run $150-220/night — a steal compared to Santorini ($250+). Eat at tavernas off the waterfront for $12-15 grilled octopus with local wine. The real group moments happen on Paros: renting ATVs ($20/day), finding empty beaches, lingering over seaside dinners.

### 15. Costa Rica (~$125/day)

The adventure group pick. A rental house near Arenal Volcano runs $180-250/night for 4-6. Zip-lining through cloud forest ($50/person), white-water rafting on the Pacuare ($90/person), surfing in Santa Teresa ($30/person).

Even non-adventure types won't be bored: hot springs near Arenal ($20/person), sloths and toucans everywhere, Pacific coast sunsets. Rent a 4x4 and split the cost. The "pura vida" attitude is real — nobody stresses on this trip.

## How to Pick the Right One for Your Group

- **Take a "vibe vote" first.** Beach or city? Relaxed or packed? Party or cultural? You'll eliminate half the list immediately.
- **Match budget to the lowest comfortable spender.** Not what most can afford — what everyone can afford. Nobody should go into debt for a vacation.
- **Factor in flight costs, not just daily spend.** Bali is cheap on the ground but expensive to reach from North America. Mexico City is a $200 flight from half the US.
- **Check visa requirements for the whole group.** Different passports, different rules. One friend's visa situation can eliminate a destination entirely.

## Turn Any Destination Into a Group Itinerary

The destination is the easy part. The hard part is coordinating flights, splitting costs, building a day-by-day plan that works for everyone, and keeping the group aligned without 400 WhatsApp messages.

That's what [MonkeyTravel's group trip planner](/group-trip-planner) is built for. Our [AI trip planner](/free-ai-trip-planner) lets everyone in the group add their preferences — budget, interests, must-dos — and generates a collaborative itinerary that balances what everybody wants. No spreadsheets, no one person doing all the work.

Pick a destination from this list, drop it into MonkeyTravel, invite your group, and let the AI handle the coordination part nobody enjoys.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the cheapest destination for a group trip in 2026?

Hoi An, Vietnam comes in at roughly $30/day per person including accommodation (split among a group), meals, activities, and local transport. Mexico City is a close second at $35/day, with the added advantage of cheaper flights from North America. Both offer genuinely excellent experiences — this isn't budget travel that feels like a compromise.

### How many people is the ideal group size for a trip?

Four to six is the sweet spot. Enough to split costs meaningfully, small enough to agree on restaurants without endless debate, and large enough that people can break into sub-groups without anyone feeling left out. Above eight, logistics become exponentially harder.

### When should we book group trip accommodation?

For popular destinations (Amalfi Coast, Greek Islands, Bali), book 4-6 months ahead — large group properties get snapped up fast. For budget destinations (Lisbon, Budapest, Mexico City), 2-3 months is fine. Book accommodation early even if your itinerary isn't finalized — group-friendly properties are the scarcest inventory everywhere.

### How do you split costs fairly on a group trip?

Agree on a system before you leave. One person books shared expenses (accommodation, group meals, transport) and everyone Venmos their share within 24 hours. For individual activities, everyone pays their own. Apps like Splitwise work well for tracking. The worst approach? "We'll figure it out later." You won't, and someone will end up quietly resentful.
