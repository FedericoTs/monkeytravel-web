# Can You Trust an AI Travel Itinerary? What to Check Before You Go

Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI trip planners can be wrong. Sometimes subtly wrong (a restaurant that shifted its hours), sometimes spectacularly wrong (a "highly rated rooftop bar" that doesn't exist and never did).

We build an AI travel planner at MonkeyTravel, and we're going to be fully transparent about what AI gets right, what it gets wrong, and exactly what you should double-check before boarding your flight. Because an honest conversation about AI travel accuracy is more useful than another "AI will plan your dream vacation!" puff piece.

If you've ever wondered whether you can trust an AI itinerary with your limited vacation days and hard-earned budget, this article is for you.

## The Good News: AI Is Getting Better Fast

First, credit where it's due. AI trip planners have improved dramatically in the last two years, and they genuinely do some things better than any human planner could:

**Geographic routing.** AI clusters your activities by neighborhood so you're not zigzagging across a city wasting hours on transit. On a 5-day trip, this typically saves 2-3 hours of total travel time. A human planning with Google Maps would need an hour just to optimize a single day's route — AI does all five days in seconds.

**Budget math.** Tell an AI planner your daily budget is $120, and it'll balance free morning activities (parks, markets, viewpoints) with paid afternoon ones (museums, tours), budget lunches to offset nicer dinners. It recalculates instantly every time you swap an activity.

**Breadth of knowledge.** A travel agent specializes in certain regions. A well-traveled friend knows maybe 30-40 cities well. AI has processed millions of reviews, blog posts, and data points across every destination on earth. For mainstream destinations, the sheer volume of information AI can synthesize is unmatched.

**Speed.** A complete, structured, day-by-day itinerary in 30 seconds versus days of research or waiting for an agent's proposal. For the "[how do I even start planning this trip?](/blog/how-to-plan-a-trip-with-ai)" phase, AI eliminates the blank-page problem entirely.

Dedicated AI trip planners — the kind that pull from Google Places and verified venue data, not just generate text — are now accurate about 85-90% of the time for restaurant and activity recommendations. That's genuinely useful. But that remaining 10-15%? It can ruin a day of your trip if you're not careful.

## Where AI Trip Planners Still Struggle

Let's talk about the AI trip planner problems that nobody puts in their marketing copy. These are real issues that affect real trips.

### Outdated Information

This is the biggest and most common problem with AI travel accuracy. AI models are trained on data that has a cutoff — and even tools that pull from live databases have lag.

A restaurant that closed three weeks ago might still show up in your itinerary. A museum that shifted to winter hours in October might be listed with its summer schedule. A popular market that moved to a new location last month? AI doesn't know yet.

Seasonal closures are particularly tricky. That gorgeous coastal restaurant in Cinque Terre? Closed November through March. The rooftop bar in Barcelona? Only open May to September. AI doesn't always flag these seasonal patterns, especially for smaller venues.

### "Hallucinated" Venues That Don't Exist

This is the most alarming AI limitation, and it's more common than you'd think — especially with general chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini.

AI can confidently recommend a "Trattoria del Ponte" in Florence with a detailed description, a rating, and a price range. The problem? It doesn't exist. The AI combined patterns from real Italian restaurants to fabricate a convincing-sounding one. This happens less frequently with dedicated travel planners that verify against real venue databases, but it still happens occasionally with lesser-known establishments.

A 2025 analysis of AI-generated travel content found that general chatbots hallucinated venues about 15-20% of the time. Dedicated AI trip planners that cross-reference Google Places data brought that down to roughly 3-5%. Better, but not zero.

### Missing Cultural Context

AI can tell you that a temple is rated 4.7 stars and is free to enter. What it might not mention:

- **Dress codes.** Many temples, churches, and mosques require covered shoulders and knees. Some will turn you away at the door if you're wearing shorts. AI rarely flags this.
- **Local customs.** Tipping etiquette varies wildly. In Japan, tipping is considered rude. In the US, not tipping is rude. AI might generate an accurate cost estimate but miss the 18-20% tip you're expected to add.
- **Religious and cultural sensitivities.** Visiting during Ramadan, a national mourning period, or a local festival changes everything about a destination. AI treats every day as a generic Tuesday.
- **Photography rules.** Some sites prohibit photography entirely. Others allow photos but not tripods. Some charge extra for camera use. AI almost never includes this information.

### Over-Optimistic Timing

AI itineraries have a persistent tendency to assume you teleport between activities. "10:00 AM — Visit the Colosseum. 11:30 AM — Lunch in Trastevere." That's technically possible on a map — it's about 25 minutes by bus. But it ignores the 15-minute security line at the Colosseum exit, the 5-minute walk to the nearest bus stop, waiting for the bus, and the 10-minute walk from the Trastevere stop to the restaurant.

Realistic timing for that sequence: you'd arrive at lunch closer to 12:15. Now multiply that gap across 6-8 activities per day, and your entire afternoon is running behind by an hour or more.

AI also underestimates how long people actually spend at attractions. "Allow 1 hour for the Uffizi Gallery" is technically possible if you speed-walk past the Botticellis. Most people spend 2-3 hours.

### Generic Recommendations vs. Local Knowledge

AI tends to recommend the obvious. For Paris, you'll get the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Sacre-Coeur, and Montmartre. These are fine recommendations — they're popular for a reason. But they're the same recommendations every AI gives every traveler, regardless of whether you've been to Paris three times or never.

The magic of travel often lives in specifics that don't show up in aggregated data: the bakery that only opens on Thursdays, the viewpoint that locals know about but doesn't appear on Google Maps, the neighborhood that's just starting to get interesting. AI struggles with this "local knowledge" layer because it optimizes for consensus, not discovery.

## The 7-Point Verification Checklist

Here's what to verify before trusting any AI-generated itinerary. This takes about 20-30 minutes and can save you hours of frustration on the ground.

### 1. Verify Each Venue Exists

**Time required:** 5-10 minutes

Open Google Maps. Search for every restaurant, bar, and attraction in your itinerary. If it doesn't appear on Google Maps with a real address, photos, and reviews — it might not exist.

Red flags: No photos from visitors. No recent reviews. An address that points to a residential area or an empty lot. A name that sounds generic ("The Local Kitchen," "Bella Vista Restaurant") without a strong online presence.

This single step catches the most dangerous AI errors.

### 2. Check Opening Hours and Seasonal Closures

**Time required:** 5 minutes

For each key venue, check the current hours on Google Maps or the venue's own website. Pay special attention to:

- Monday closures (common for European museums)
- Seasonal hours (summer vs. winter schedules)
- Holiday closures (national holidays, religious observances)
- Last entry times (many museums stop admitting visitors 30-60 minutes before closing)

Pro tip: Check the venue's Instagram or Facebook page. They'll often post about temporary closures or special hours faster than they update Google.

### 3. Validate Travel Times Between Activities

**Time required:** 3-5 minutes

Plug your sequence of activities into Google Maps as a multi-stop route. Use the transit mode you'll actually be using (walking, bus, metro — not driving, unless you're renting a car).

Add a buffer. The AI says 15 minutes? Budget 25. Google says 30 minutes by metro? That doesn't include the walk to the station, the wait, and the walk from the exit. Budget 45.

### 4. Research Local Customs and Dress Codes

**Time required:** 3-5 minutes

If your itinerary includes any religious sites, government buildings, or traditional establishments, do a quick search for "[venue name] dress code" or "[country] cultural etiquette for tourists."

Key things to check:
- Dress requirements at temples, churches, mosques
- Tipping expectations at restaurants
- Bargaining customs at markets
- Photography restrictions
- Common scams targeting tourists in your destination

### 5. Confirm Booking Requirements

**Time required:** 3-5 minutes

Some attractions require advance booking — and AI doesn't always make this clear.

Check whether you need:
- Timed entry tickets (common for popular museums and landmarks)
- Restaurant reservations (essential for popular spots, especially dinner)
- Tour group pre-booking (walking tours, cooking classes, day trips)
- Advance purchase for discounts (many attractions charge more at the door)

The Alhambra in Granada, Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, and the Last Supper viewing in Milan all require booking weeks or months in advance. Showing up day-of means you're not getting in.

### 6. Check Visa and Entry Requirements

**Time required:** 2-3 minutes

AI itineraries sometimes suggest multi-country trips without flagging visa requirements. If your itinerary crosses borders — even on a day trip — verify:

- Visa requirements for your passport
- Entry fees or tourist taxes
- COVID or health documentation (some countries still require it)
- Transit visa requirements if you're connecting through a third country

Use your government's official travel advisory website for the most current information.

### 7. Verify Current Prices

**Time required:** 3-5 minutes

AI cost estimates can be outdated by 6-12 months. Prices change due to inflation, seasonal pricing, and currency fluctuations.

Check current prices for:
- Museum and attraction entry fees
- Restaurant price ranges (menus are often posted online)
- Local transportation costs (metro tickets, taxi fares)
- Any tours or experiences in your plan

If the AI estimates $15 for a museum that now costs $22, those gaps add up across a full itinerary. Recalculating your daily budget with current prices prevents unpleasant surprises.

## How Modern AI Planners Are Solving These Problems

Not all AI trip planners are created equal, and the best ones are actively working to address these limitations.

**Real venue verification.** Dedicated AI travel planners like MonkeyTravel pull from Google Places and verified business data rather than generating venue names from patterns. Every restaurant, museum, and attraction in your itinerary maps to a real, verified place with a confirmed address. This drastically reduces hallucination — though data freshness remains a challenge across the industry.

**Smart geographic routing.** Instead of listing attractions in order of popularity, modern AI planners sequence activities geographically. Everything in the same neighborhood is grouped together, minimizing transit time and those over-optimistic "teleportation" schedules.

**Budget-tier options.** Rather than a single cost estimate, the best planners offer multiple budget tiers — budget, balanced, and premium — with different venues for each. This gives you realistic options instead of a single price point that may not match reality.

**Continuous data updates.** The gap between a venue closing and AI knowing about it is shrinking. Tools that integrate with live Google Places data catch closures faster than tools that rely on static training data. It's not perfect — there's still a lag — but the window is narrowing.

**User feedback loops.** When travelers report that a venue has closed or moved, that feedback improves future itineraries for everyone. This crowdsourced verification layer is something static AI models can't offer.

The difference between a general chatbot and a dedicated AI trip planner is significant. Asking ChatGPT to plan your trip is like asking a knowledgeable friend who hasn't traveled in a year — [the advice is reasonable but unverified](/blog/ai-trip-planner-vs-travel-agent). Using a dedicated planner is closer to hiring a researcher who cross-references every recommendation against current data.

## The Bottom Line: Trust but Verify

Can you trust an AI travel itinerary? Yes — but with the same healthy skepticism you'd apply to any single source of travel advice.

Think of AI as an exceptionally fast first draft. It handles the logistics, routing, and budget math better than you can manually. It gives you a structured starting point that would take hours to create on your own. But it's a starting point, not a finished plan.

The 20-30 minutes you spend on the verification checklist above is the difference between a trip that flows smoothly and one where you're standing in front of a closed restaurant, Googling alternatives on your phone.

Here's the approach we recommend:

1. **Generate your itinerary** with an AI planner that uses real venue data — not a general chatbot.
2. **Run through the 7-point checklist** above. It takes less time than a single episode of your favorite show.
3. **Build in flexibility.** Don't schedule every hour. The best travel moments are the ones you didn't plan. Use the AI itinerary as a menu of verified options, not a rigid minute-by-minute schedule.
4. **Keep a backup list.** For every key activity, note one alternative nearby. If the restaurant is unexpectedly closed, you already know what's next door.

AI travel accuracy will keep improving. Hallucinations will get rarer. Data freshness gaps will shrink. But even the best AI won't replace your judgment about what makes a trip meaningful to you. The goal isn't to blindly trust or blindly distrust — it's to let AI handle what it's good at (logistics, research, optimization) while you handle what you're good at (priorities, flexibility, spontaneity).

Your vacation days are too valuable for unverified plans. Verify the details, then relax and enjoy the trip.

## FAQ

### How accurate are AI trip planners in 2026?

Dedicated AI trip planners that use real-time venue data (Google Places, verified reviews) are roughly 85-90% accurate for venue recommendations. General chatbots like ChatGPT are less reliable, with hallucination rates around 15-20% for specific venue names and details. Always run through a quick verification checklist before your trip.

### What's the most common mistake AI itineraries make?

Over-optimistic timing. AI itineraries frequently underestimate how long it takes to move between activities, wait in lines, or actually enjoy an attraction. Budget 30-50% more time than the AI suggests for each activity, and you'll have a much more relaxed trip.

### Should I still use a travel agent instead of AI?

For standard city trips, AI delivers comparable itinerary quality to a travel agent — faster and cheaper. For complex trips (multi-country, luxury, remote destinations), a travel agent's personal experience and vendor relationships still add significant value. Many smart travelers use both: [AI for the base itinerary, an agent for specific high-stakes bookings](/blog/ai-trip-planner-vs-travel-agent).

### Can AI understand my personal travel preferences?

AI is surprisingly good at adjusting for stated preferences — "we love food, prefer walking, avoid tourist traps." It's less good at unstated ones. It won't know that you hate crowds unless you say so, or that your partner gets altitude sickness above 3,000 meters. The more specific you are with your inputs, the better the output.

### What should I verify first in an AI itinerary?

Start with venue existence (Google Maps check) and opening hours. These are the most common failure points and the easiest to verify. If a key restaurant or attraction doesn't exist or is closed on the day you've planned to visit, it cascades into the rest of your schedule.
