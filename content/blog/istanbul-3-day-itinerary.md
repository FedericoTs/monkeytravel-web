# Istanbul 3-Day Itinerary: The Practical Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Istanbul is one of the only cities in the world where you can eat breakfast in Europe, take a ferry to Asia for lunch, and be back on the European side in time for sunset drinks — all for less than the price of a coffee in London.

Three days is not enough for Istanbul. Nothing is. But three days is enough to see the big landmarks, eat extraordinarily well, and understand why this city has been the capital of three empires. This itinerary is built on real distances, real 2026 prices, and actual transit routing. No "just wander" filler — you will be on your feet all day, and you need a plan.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Around

Istanbul's public transport runs on the **Istanbulkart**, a rechargeable contactless card that works on trams, buses, metros, ferries, and the Marmaray tunnel. The card itself costs **165 TL (~$5)** and you load credit onto it. A single tram or metro ride is **27 TL (~$0.80)**. Ferry rides are **38-45 TL (~$1.10-$1.30)**. You can buy the card at kiosks near any tram or metro station.

**Important:** As a tourist, you will not get transfer discounts. Each tap is a full fare. Still absurdly cheap compared to European transit.

**From the airports:**

- **Istanbul Airport (IST):** The Havaist bus runs to Sultanahmet/Taksim for about **180 TL (~$5)**. Takes 60-90 minutes depending on traffic. Taxis are around 700-1000 TL ($20-30) but Istanbul traffic can make this miserable.
- **Sabiha Gokcen (SAW):** On the Asian side. Havabus to Kadikoy or Taksim runs about **180 TL**. Add 90+ minutes for traffic.

**The T1 tram is your best friend.** It connects the airport bus stop at Aksaray/Laleli through Sultanahmet, Eminonu (ferries), over the Galata Bridge, and up to Karakoy. You will ride it constantly.

### When to Visit

Istanbul's weather swings hard:

- **April-June:** Best overall. 15-27°C, tulip season in April, long daylight hours, manageable crowds
- **July-August:** Hot and humid (30-35°C). Outdoor sightseeing is tough after noon. But rooftop bars are in full swing
- **September-October:** Excellent. Warm, crowds thin after September, the light over the Bosphorus is golden
- **November-March:** Cool to cold (5-12°C), rainy. But hotel prices drop 40-60%, and the mosques are atmospheric in the mist

### Budget Breakdown

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hotel/night | €35-60 | €80-150 | €200+ |
| Food/day | €15-25 | €35-65 | €100+ |
| Transport/day | €3-5 | €5-10 | €20+ (taxis) |
| Activities/day | €10-30 | €35-70 | €100+ |
| **Daily Total** | **€63-120** | **€155-295** | **€420+** |

Istanbul is dramatically cheaper than Western European capitals. A sit-down kebab meal with drinks rarely exceeds €10. The major cost is museum tickets, which have climbed steeply for foreign visitors in recent years.

### Museum & Attraction Prices (2026)

| Attraction | Price | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hagia Sophia | **€25** | Separate ticket, not on Museum Pass |
| Topkapi Palace + Harem | **€45-55** | Combined ticket recommended |
| Basilica Cistern | **€23-31** | Evening entry more expensive |
| Galata Tower | **€30** | Museum Pass accepted |
| Blue Mosque | **Free** | Closed during prayer times |
| Grand Bazaar | **Free** | Closed Sundays |
| Spice Bazaar | **Free** | Closed Sundays |
| Bosphorus Short Cruise | **€7-8** | Sehir Hatlari from Eminonu |
| Museum Pass Istanbul | **€105** | 5 days, 30+ museums (NOT Hagia Sophia) |

**Is the Museum Pass worth it?** Only if you are visiting 3+ museums beyond Hagia Sophia. Topkapi + Galata Tower + one or two smaller museums and it pays for itself. Note that Hagia Sophia is NOT included in the Museum Pass — you always need a separate ticket.

## Day 1: Sultanahmet — The Historic Heart

This is the densest day. All the heavyweight sights are within walking distance of each other in Sultanahmet, the old walled city that was the center of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.

### Morning: Hagia Sophia & Blue Mosque (8:30 AM)

Start early. **Hagia Sophia** opens at 9:00 AM, and the lines grow fast after 10:00. Buy your ticket online in advance (€25) to save time. This building was the largest cathedral in the world for nearly 1,000 years before becoming a mosque, then a museum, and now a mosque again. Non-Muslim visitors are welcome but should dress modestly (long pants, covered shoulders; headscarves provided for women at the entrance).

Give yourself 45-60 minutes inside. The scale is staggering — the dome appears to float. Look up at the Byzantine mosaics in the upper galleries (accessible via a ramp on the left side). The weeping column near the northwest pillar is where visitors stick their thumb in a hole and make a wish — the queue for this is not worth your time.

Walk across the park to the **Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmed Mosque)** — it is literally a 3-minute walk. Entry is **free**, but it closes to visitors during the five daily prayer times (check the posted schedule at the entrance; midday prayer around 1:00-1:30 PM is the longest closure). Remove your shoes, women cover heads. The interior is covered in over 20,000 hand-painted blue Iznik tiles — this is where the name comes from.

**Tip:** Visit the Blue Mosque first thing if Hagia Sophia has a long line. The mosque is quietest before 9:30 AM.

### Late Morning: Basilica Cistern (10:30 AM)

A 5-minute walk from Hagia Sophia, the **Basilica Cistern** is an underground water reservoir built by Emperor Justinian in 532 AD. It is atmospheric and eerie — 336 marble columns rising from still water, lit with amber lights. Look for the two Medusa head column bases in the far-left corner.

Tickets cost **€23-31** depending on time slot. The visit takes about 30 minutes. It is cool down here, which is welcome in summer.

### Midday: Topkapi Palace (11:30 AM)

Walk 10 minutes uphill through Gulhane Park to **Topkapi Palace**, the residence of Ottoman sultans for nearly 400 years. The combined ticket (Palace + Harem + Hagia Irene) is **€45-55** — the Harem section is absolutely worth the extra cost. Without it, you miss the most lavish rooms.

**Budget at least 2 hours here.** The palace is enormous. Highlights:

- **The Harem:** Intricate tilework, the Sultan's private quarters, the courtyard of the concubines. This alone justifies the visit.
- **The Treasury:** Home to the 86-carat Spoonmaker's Diamond and the Topkapi Dagger.
- **The Fourth Courtyard:** The terrace overlooks the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus, and the Sea of Marmara simultaneously. Possibly the best free view in Istanbul.

**Lunch Break: Sultanahmet Area (1:30 PM)**

You will be hungry. Options near Sultanahmet:

- **Sultanahmet Koftecisi** (Divanyolu Caddesi): The original Istanbul meatball restaurant, open since 1920. Kofte plate with bread and salad: 180-220 TL (~€5-6). Simple, fast, excellent. Beware of the copycat restaurant next door — look for the green sign.
- **Seven Hills Restaurant** (rooftop, Tevkifhane Sokak): Touristy but the rooftop view of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia is unbeatable. Mains 400-600 TL (~€12-18). Worth it for the view alone.
- **Tarihi Cesme Restaurant** (near the Basilica Cistern): Grilled lamb chops and pide (Turkish flatbread pizza) at local prices. 250-350 TL (~€7-10) for a full meal.

### Afternoon: The Grand Bazaar (3:00 PM)

Walk 10 minutes west from Sultanahmet to the **Grand Bazaar (Kapali Carsi)** — one of the oldest and largest covered markets in the world, with over 4,000 shops across 61 covered streets. Entry is free. Closed Sundays.

This place is overwhelming by design. A few survival tips:

- **Don't buy at the first shop.** Prices vary wildly. Walk the entire section for whatever you want before committing.
- **Bargaining is expected** for textiles, ceramics, and leather. Start at 40-50% of the asking price. For gold and silver, margins are thinner.
- **Good buys:** Hand-painted ceramics, Turkish towels (peshtemal), spices, Turkish delight (lokum), leather goods.
- **Skip:** "Pashmina" scarves (almost always synthetic), "antique" items (usually not), and anything sold by someone standing outside the bazaar shouting at you.

**Tip:** The bazaar has several excellent small cafes hidden inside. **Sark Kahvesi** (near the center) serves Turkish coffee the traditional way — thick, strong, in tiny cups. 50 TL for a coffee that will keep you wired for hours.

### Evening: Sunset at the Galata Bridge (6:00 PM)

Walk downhill from the Grand Bazaar through the narrow streets to **Eminonu** and the **Galata Bridge**. The lower level of the bridge is lined with fish restaurants — they are overpriced and the fish quality is hit-or-miss. But standing on the upper level of the bridge at sunset, watching the fishermen with the mosques and minarets silhouetted behind you, is one of Istanbul's iconic experiences.

**Dinner: Eminonu Street Food**

Before or after sunset, grab one of Istanbul's most famous street foods at the Eminonu waterfront:

- **Balik Ekmek (fish sandwich):** Grilled mackerel in a half-loaf of bread with onions and lettuce. The boats next to the Galata Bridge have sold these for generations. **40-60 TL (~€1.20-1.80)**. Touristy, but genuinely good.
- **Simit:** The Turkish sesame bread ring, sold by street vendors everywhere. **10-15 TL**. Breakfast, snack, or late-night walking food.

---

## Day 2: Bosphorus, Spice Bazaar & the Asian Side

Today you cross to Asia. The ferry ride alone is worth the entire day.

### Morning: Spice Bazaar & Turkish Breakfast (8:30 AM)

Start at the **Spice Bazaar (Misir Carsisi)** in Eminonu, a 5-minute walk from the Galata Bridge. It opens at 8:00 AM and is far less overwhelming than the Grand Bazaar — just one L-shaped corridor of spice, tea, and Turkish delight vendors.

**What to buy:** Turkish tea (cay), sumac, pul biber (Aleppo pepper flakes), pomegranate molasses, dried figs, and Turkish delight. Prices are reasonable — a bag of quality spices runs 50-120 TL. The shops near the entrance are pricier; walk deeper inside for better deals.

Before or after the Spice Bazaar, get a proper **Turkish breakfast (kahvalti)** — this is one of the great meal experiences in the world. A typical spread includes cheeses, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, honey, kaymak (clotted cream), sucuklu yumurta (eggs with Turkish sausage), fresh bread, and unlimited cay (tea).

- **Hafiz Mustafa 1864** (Eminonu branch, right near the Spice Bazaar): A historic pastry shop and cafe. Full breakfast spread: 300-450 TL (~€9-13). The baklava here is some of the best in Istanbul — try the pistachio version.

### Late Morning: Short Bosphorus Cruise (11:00 AM)

Walk back to **Eminonu ferry terminal** for a short Bosphorus cruise. The **Sehir Hatlari** (city ferry line) runs a short circle tour departing around 14:40 PM, but private operators at Eminonu offer 90-minute tours throughout the morning starting from **250-300 TL (~€7-9)**.

The cruise takes you up the Bosphorus strait between Europe and Asia, past:

- **Dolmabahce Palace** (the last Ottoman palace, European side)
- **Ortakoy Mosque** (tiny baroque mosque right under the Bosphorus Bridge)
- **Rumeli Hisari** (15th-century Ottoman fortress)
- Historic waterfront mansions (yalis) on both shores

Sit on the right side (starboard) heading north for the best European shore views. Bring a jacket — the wind on the Bosphorus is cold even in summer.

### Afternoon: Ferry to Kadikoy — the Asian Side (1:30 PM)

After the cruise, head back to Eminonu and take the **regular commuter ferry to Kadikoy** — this is not a tour, just a regular city ferry, and it is one of the best experiences in Istanbul. The ride takes 20 minutes, costs only your Istanbulkart tap (**38-45 TL**), and the views of the old city skyline from the water are extraordinary.

**Kadikoy** is where Istanbulites actually live, eat, and shop. It has none of the tourist-trap energy of Sultanahmet. The streets are lively, the food is better and cheaper, and the vibe is more relaxed.

**Lunch in Kadikoy (2:30 PM):**

- **Ciya Sofrasi** (Guneslibahce Sokak): This is the restaurant that put Kadikoy on the food map. Chef Musa Dagdeviren serves regional Anatolian dishes that have disappeared from most menus — things like lamb with quince, or kebabs with sour cherry. Mains 200-350 TL (~€6-10). Arrive before 1:00 PM or after 2:30 PM to avoid the lunch rush. This is a must.
- **Kadikoy Fish Market (Balik Pazari):** Walk through the narrow fish market street and pick a restaurant on the edge. Point at the fish you want, they grill it. A plate of grilled sea bass with a salad and raki: 350-500 TL (~€10-15).
- **Baylan Pastanesi** (Kadikoy waterfront area): One of Istanbul's oldest patisseries, open since 1923. The **kup griye** (a layered ice cream and caramel dessert) is legendary. 100-150 TL.

### Afternoon: Kadikoy Streets & Moda (3:30 PM)

After lunch, walk through the **Kadikoy market streets** — the produce market, the fish market, the vintage shops on Bahariye Caddesi. Then head south to the **Moda neighborhood**, an upscale residential area with a waterfront promenade that offers panoramic views of the old city and the Princes' Islands.

Walk the **Moda coastal path** — a 2 km loop around the small peninsula. There are tea gardens and benches along the way. This is where locals come for sunset.

### Evening: Return & Dinner in Eminonu/Karakoy (6:30 PM)

Take the ferry back from Kadikoy to Eminonu (runs every 15-20 minutes until late). From Eminonu, you are a short walk or one tram stop from **Karakoy**, which has become Istanbul's trendiest food and bar neighborhood.

**Dinner in Karakoy:**

- **Karakoy Lokantasi** (Kemankes Caddesi): A modern lokanta (canteen-style restaurant) with superb Ottoman-inspired dishes. Try the lamb shank or the manti (Turkish dumplings). Mains 350-500 TL (~€10-15).
- **Namlı Gurme** (Rıhtım Caddesi): A deli-restaurant with an insane cheese and charcuterie selection. The breakfast is legendary too, if you come back tomorrow. Mains 250-400 TL (~€7-12).

## Day 3: Beyoglu, Galata & the Hammam

Your last day explores the 19th-century European quarter — Beyoglu — which is where modern Istanbul lives. This is the neighborhood of art galleries, rooftop bars, independent shops, and the city's best street food.

### Morning: Galata Tower & Karakoy (9:00 AM)

Start at the **Galata Tower**, the 14th-century Genoese watchtower that dominates the Beyoglu skyline. Entry is **€30** (or use your Museum Pass). The 360-degree view from the top is the best panorama in Istanbul — you can see the old city, the Bosphorus, the Asian side, and the Golden Horn all at once.

Go early. The tower is small and the observation deck gets crowded fast. Budget 45-60 minutes.

After the tower, walk downhill through the steep cobblestone streets of **Galata/Karakoy**. This neighborhood has transformed in the past decade — what was a gritty port district is now full of specialty coffee shops, design stores, and small galleries. A few highlights:

- **Karakoy Gulluoglu**: The Istanbul outpost of the legendary Gaziantep baklava family. A box of assorted baklava: 300-500 TL depending on weight. The pistachio baklava is the gold standard.
- **Coffee shops:** Kronotrop, Petra Roasting Co., and Coffee Department are all within a few blocks. Proper specialty coffee: 80-130 TL.

### Late Morning: Istiklal Caddesi & Beyoglu (10:30 AM)

Walk uphill from Galata to **Istiklal Caddesi**, the famous 1.4 km pedestrian avenue that is the beating heart of modern Istanbul. The historic red **nostalgic tram** runs the length of the street (it is slow and mostly for fun).

Istiklal is busy, loud, and chaotic. That is the charm. Along the way:

- **Cicek Pasaji (Flower Passage):** A stunning 19th-century arcade converted into a row of meyhanes (Turkish taverns). Atmospheric for a drink, but overpriced for a full meal.
- **Balik Pazari (Fish Market, off Istiklal):** Next to Cicek Pasaji. A narrow alley of seafood stalls, pickle shops, and tiny restaurants. Try **midye dolma** (stuffed mussels) from a street vendor — 10-15 TL each, addictive.
- **St. Anthony of Padua Church:** The largest Catholic church in Istanbul, with a gorgeous neo-Gothic interior. Free entry.
- **Side streets:** The real character of Beyoglu is in the alleys branching off Istiklal. Explore Asmalimescit (bars and restaurants), Cezayir Sokak (the French Street, leafy and cafe-lined), and Nevizade Sokak (meyhane row — lively at night).

### Lunch: Beyoglu Style (12:30 PM)

- **Antiochia** (Asmalimescit): Hatay-style southeastern Turkish food. The hummus and kebabs are exceptional. Mains 200-350 TL (~€6-10).
- **Zubeyir Ocakbasi** (off Istiklal): One of the best ocakbasi (charcoal grill) restaurants in the city. The Adana kebab and lamb ribs are outstanding. Mains 250-400 TL (~€7-12). Lunch is less crowded than dinner.
- **Dürümzade** (Kalyoncu Kullugu Caddesi): Possibly the best dürüm (wrap) in Istanbul. The lahmacun (thin Turkish pizza) rolled with lettuce and lemon is a perfect quick lunch. 100-150 TL.

### Afternoon: Hammam Experience (2:30 PM)

No trip to Istanbul is complete without a **hammam (Turkish bath)**. This is not a spa day — it is a 500-year-old bathing tradition that will leave you cleaner than you have ever been.

**What to expect:** You will be in a hot marble room (the hararet). An attendant will scrub you with a coarse mitt (kese) — removing a shocking amount of dead skin — then wash you with soap foam, and optionally give you a massage. The whole process takes 45-60 minutes.

**Recommended hammams:**

- **Kilic Ali Pasa Hamami** (Karakoy): Beautifully restored 16th-century hammam designed by Mimar Sinan, the Ottoman master architect. The bath + scrub + foam massage package is around **€60-80**. This is the most refined hammam experience in Istanbul. Book online in advance.
- **Cagaloglu Hamami** (Sultanahmet): One of the last Ottoman-era hammams, built in 1741. More traditional, slightly less polished. Packages from **€50-70**.
- **Tarihi Galatasaray Hamami** (off Istiklal, Beyoglu): A local favorite since 1481. Less touristy, more authentic. Packages from **€35-50**.

**Tips:** Bring your own towel and flip-flops if you want, though all hammams provide them. Swimwear is optional — most people wrap in a pestemal (thin cotton towel). Tip the attendant 20-30% if the service is good.

### Late Afternoon: Taksim & Rooftop Views (4:30 PM)

Walk to the top of Istiklal to **Taksim Square** — historically important but architecturally unexciting. The square itself is mostly a transit hub. The real attraction is the neighborhood around it.

For a farewell drink with a view, head to one of Istanbul's rooftop bars:

- **Mikla** (The Marmara Pera hotel, 18th floor): High-end cocktails with arguably the best sunset view in the city — straight across to the old city and the Bosphorus. Cocktails 300-450 TL (~€9-13). Smart casual dress.
- **360 Istanbul** (Istiklal Caddesi): A classic rooftop bar-restaurant. Good cocktails, solid view, more accessible vibe. Cocktails 250-400 TL (~€7-12).
- **5. Kat** (Soganaga Caddesi, Beyoglu): A more local, bohemian rooftop. Cheaper drinks, great atmosphere. Beer 100-150 TL.

### Evening: Farewell Dinner (7:30 PM)

For your last evening, go big:

- **Mikla** (if you splurge): Chef Mehmet Gurs serves Turkish-Scandinavian fusion with a tasting menu around 3000-4000 TL (~€90-120). One of Istanbul's best restaurants.
- **Asmalimescit Meyhane Row:** For a more traditional final night, head to the meyhanes in Asmalimescit. Order meze (small plates) — haydari (thick yogurt dip), sigara boregi (fried feta rolls), octopus salad — with raki (anise spirit). A meze-and-raki dinner for two with drinks: 800-1200 TL (~€25-35). The meyhanes get lively after 9 PM with live music.

## Practical Tips & FAQ

### Money

The Turkish Lira (TL/TRY) fluctuates significantly. As of early 2026, **1 EUR = approximately 34-36 TL** and **1 USD = approximately 33-35 TL**. Most tourist shops and restaurants accept credit cards, but carry some cash for:

- Istanbulkart top-ups (cash only at some kiosks)
- Small street food vendors
- Grand Bazaar bargaining (cash gets better deals)
- Tipping

ATMs are everywhere. Use Ziraat, Garanti, or Isbank ATMs to avoid extra fees.

### Tipping

- **Restaurants:** 10-15% is standard. Check if service charge is included.
- **Hammam attendants:** 20-30%.
- **Hotel staff:** 20-50 TL per service.
- **Taxi drivers:** Round up to the nearest 10 TL.

### Safety

Istanbul is generally very safe for tourists. Pickpocketing exists in Sultanahmet and on crowded trams — keep valuables in front pockets. The biggest "scam" is shoe shiners who drop their brush in front of you, pick it up, then insist on shining your shoes and charge excessively. Just keep walking.

### Dress Code for Mosques

Both Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque require:

- Covered shoulders and knees (both men and women)
- Headscarf for women (provided free at the entrance)
- Shoes removed (you carry them in a bag)
- No loud talking or flash photography

### Is 3 Days Enough?

Honestly, no. You could spend a week and barely scratch the surface. If you have a fourth day, add: the **Princes' Islands** (a 90-minute ferry to car-free islands with pine forests and Ottoman mansions), the **Suleymaniye Mosque** (Sinan's masterpiece, arguably more impressive than the Blue Mosque), or the **Chora Church** (extraordinary Byzantine mosaics).

But three days, done right, gives you the highlights and leaves you wanting more. Which is exactly what Istanbul does best.
