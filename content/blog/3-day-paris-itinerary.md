# The Perfect 3-Day Paris Itinerary: A Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Three days in Paris isn't enough. Everyone who's been will tell you that. But three days is what most people have — and with the right plan, you can see the icons, eat incredibly well, and still have time to get lost in a neighborhood that isn't in any guidebook.

This itinerary is built on real distances, real opening hours, and real prices as of 2026. No "just wander and see what happens" — that advice wastes half your trip walking in the wrong direction.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Around

The Paris Métro is your best friend. A single ticket (t+) costs €2.15, but buy a **carnet of 10** for €16.90 or load a **Navigo Easy** card. If you're using the Métro more than 5 times a day, consider the **Navigo Jour** (day pass) at €8.45 — it covers all zones including the RER to Versailles.

From CDG airport: RER B train to central Paris takes 35 minutes and costs €11.45. Taxis have a flat rate of €56 (Right Bank) or €65 (Left Bank). Skip Uber during peak hours — it's often more expensive than a taxi.

### Museum Passes

The **Paris Museum Pass** (€62 for 2 days, €78 for 4 days) covers 60+ museums including the Louvre, Orsay, and Arc de Triomphe. If you plan to visit 3+ museums, it pays for itself and lets you skip ticket lines.

**Important:** Even with the Museum Pass, the Louvre and Orsay require **timed-entry reservations** in 2026. Book these on their official sites at least a week ahead.

### Budget Breakdown

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hotel/night | €80-120 | €150-250 | €300+ |
| Food/day | €30-50 | €60-100 | €150+ |
| Transport/day | €8-15 | €15-25 | €30+ |
| Activities/day | €15-30 | €30-60 | €80+ |
| **Daily Total** | **€133-215** | **€255-435** | **€560+** |

## Day 1: The Icons — Eiffel Tower, Seine & Left Bank

### Morning: Eiffel Tower (9:00 AM)

Book your Eiffel Tower tickets online — walk-ups face 2-3 hour waits. Timed-entry is mandatory in 2026.

- **Summit tickets:** €29.40 per adult (elevator)
- **Second floor only:** €18.80
- **Stairs to 2nd floor + elevator to summit:** €23.10 (best value, shorter line)

**Tip:** Book the earliest time slot (9:00 or 9:30 AM). Crowds triple by 11:00. Take the stairs to the second floor if you're able — the views on the way up are better than from the elevator, and the line moves faster.

After the tower, walk across the **Pont d'Iéna** to the **Trocadéro** for the classic photo op. This takes 10 minutes and costs nothing.

### Late Morning: Rue Cler Market Street (11:00 AM)

Walk 15 minutes south to **Rue Cler** (7th arrondissement), one of Paris's best market streets. This is where locals shop. Grab:

- A crêpe from a street vendor (€4-6)
- Cheese and charcuterie from the fromageries
- A fresh baguette from the boulangerie

Sit on a bench or find a café terrace. This is a better Paris experience than any sit-down tourist restaurant near the tower.

### Afternoon: Musée d'Orsay (1:30 PM)

Walk along the Seine (20 minutes) or take the RER C one stop to **Musée d'Orsay**. This converted railway station houses the world's greatest collection of Impressionist art — Monet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh.

- **Tickets:** €16 (free for under-26 EU residents)
- **Hours:** 9:30 AM - 6:00 PM (until 9:45 PM on Thursdays). Closed Mondays.
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours

Don't miss the 5th floor for Impressionist masterpieces and the clock windows with views over the Seine toward Montmartre.

### Evening: Saint-Germain-des-Prés (5:00 PM)

Walk south into **Saint-Germain-des-Prés**, Paris's literary and café district. Stop at **Café de Flore** or **Les Deux Magots** for a coffee (€6-8) — yes, it's touristy, but the people-watching is unmatched.

For dinner, skip the boulevard and head one block back. **Le Bouillon Racine** (Art Nouveau interior, mains €12-18) or **Le Comptoir du Panthéon** offer excellent value. A traditional French dinner with wine runs €25-40 per person at local bistros in this area.

### Night: Seine Walk

Walk along the **Quais de Seine** after dark. The Eiffel Tower sparkles on the hour for 5 minutes (every hour until 1 AM). Free, and better than any paid attraction.

## Day 2: Art, History & Montmartre

### Morning: The Louvre (9:00 AM)

The Louvre needs no introduction — but it needs a strategy. With 380,000 objects across 72,735 square meters, you can't see everything. Don't try.

- **Tickets:** €22 (timed entry required, book at louvre.fr)
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (until 9:00 PM on Fridays). Closed Tuesdays.
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours with focus

**The efficient route:** Enter through the Passage Richelieu (shorter line than the pyramid). Head straight to the Denon Wing for the Mona Lisa, Winged Victory of Samothrace, and Venus de Milo. Then explore the Richelieu Wing's French paintings and Napoleon III apartments — far fewer crowds.

**Pro tip:** Friday evenings (6-9 PM) are the Louvre's best-kept secret. Half the crowds, same price.

### Lunch: Le Marais (12:30 PM)

Walk 15 minutes east to **Le Marais**, Paris's trendiest neighborhood. This is where Parisians actually eat lunch.

- **L'As du Fallafel** on Rue des Rosiers: The best falafel in Paris (€8-10, expect a line)
- **Breizh Café**: Outstanding galettes and crêpes (€10-15)
- **Marché des Enfants Rouges**: Paris's oldest covered market, with stalls serving Japanese, Moroccan, Italian, and French food (€8-15)

### Afternoon: Île de la Cité & Sainte-Chapelle (2:30 PM)

Cross to **Île de la Cité**, the historic heart of Paris. Notre-Dame's restoration after the 2019 fire is now complete — the cathedral reopened in December 2024 and entry is free, though timed tickets are recommended.

Then visit **Sainte-Chapelle** (5 minutes away), often called Paris's most beautiful building. The 13th-century stained glass windows are staggering.

- **Tickets:** €13
- **Time needed:** 30-45 minutes
- **Tip:** Visit on a sunny afternoon when light floods through the 1,113 stained glass panels

### Evening: Montmartre (5:00 PM)

Take the Métro to **Abbesses** station (Line 12) and climb into Montmartre. Start at **Place du Tertre** where artists still paint portraits, then walk to **Sacré-Cœur Basilica** for the best free panoramic view of Paris.

Walk down through the winding streets. Stop at **Le Consulat** or **La Maison Rose** (the famous pink restaurant). For dinner, try **Le Bouillon Pigalle** — a modern take on the traditional Parisian bouillon with 3-course menus from €15.

## Day 3: Versailles or Neighborhoods — Your Choice

You have two great options for Day 3. Choose based on your interests:

### Option A: Versailles Day Trip

Take the RER C from central Paris to **Versailles Château Rive Gauche** (35-45 minutes, €4.30 each way with Navigo or €7.60 without). Walk 10 minutes to the palace.

- **Passport ticket:** €21.50 (palace + gardens + Trianon estate). Timed entry mandatory — book at chateauversailles.fr.
- **Gardens only:** Free most days (€10 on musical fountain show days, April-October on weekends)
- **Time needed:** 5-6 hours minimum

**Strategy:** Arrive at opening (9:00 AM). Start with the palace (Hall of Mirrors, King's and Queen's Apartments — 90 minutes), then walk to the gardens. If time allows, visit the **Grand Trianon** and **Marie-Antoinette's Estate** — fewer crowds and arguably more charming than the main palace.

Return to Paris by mid-afternoon. Spend your last evening at **Le Marais** or **Canal Saint-Martin** for a final Parisian dinner.

### Option B: The Paris Nobody Tells You About

Skip the day trip. Instead, explore the neighborhoods that make Paris feel like home:

**Morning:** Start at **Du Pain et Des Idées** (34 Rue Yves Toudic, 10th arr.) for the best croissant in Paris — arrive by 8:30 AM before they sell out. Then walk along **Canal Saint-Martin**, the Instagram-famous iron footbridges and tree-lined canal from the movie Amélie.

**Midday:** Walk to **Rue des Martyrs** (9th arr.), a market street with some of the best cheese, chocolate, and pastry shops in the city. Pick up supplies for a picnic.

**Afternoon:** Take your picnic to **Parc des Buttes-Chaumont** (19th arr.) — a dramatically hilly park with waterfalls, a temple on an island, and zero tourists. Or visit **Musée de l'Orangerie** in the Tuileries Garden to see Monet's Water Lilies in the oval rooms they were designed for (€12.50, 1 hour).

**Evening:** End in **Belleville** (20th arr.), Paris's most multicultural neighborhood. **Le Baratin** offers natural wine and French cooking at local prices. Then walk up to **Parc de Belleville** for a sunset view over the entire city that rivals Sacré-Cœur — without the crowds.

## How Much Does 3 Days in Paris Cost?

Here's a realistic budget for 3 days, per person:

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Accommodation (3 nights) | €240-360 | €450-750 |
| Food (3 days) | €90-150 | €180-300 |
| Transport (Métro + airport) | €40-55 | €55-75 |
| Activities | €50-80 | €100-160 |
| **Total** | **€420-645** | **€785-1,285** |

**Money-saving tips:**
- Eat your big meal at lunch — many restaurants offer **formule** (set lunch) menus at half the dinner price
- Drink wine at cave à manger (wine bars) instead of restaurants — same quality, lower markup
- The first Sunday of each month, many national museums are **free** (Louvre, Orsay, Orangerie)
- Fill your water bottle at the green **Wallace fountains** throughout the city — they're everywhere and the water is excellent

## FAQ

### Is 3 days enough for Paris?

Three days covers the major icons (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Montmartre, Notre-Dame) plus time for neighborhood exploration and great food. It's tight but doable with good planning. Most first-time visitors find 3-4 days ideal.

### What is the best area to stay in Paris for 3 days?

Le Marais (3rd-4th arr.) offers the best balance: central location, walkable to major sights, excellent restaurants, and good Métro connections. Saint-Germain (6th arr.) is equally central but pricier. For budget travelers, the 10th and 11th arrondissements offer local charm at lower prices with easy Métro access.

### How much money do I need for 3 days in Paris?

Budget travelers can manage €140-215 per day ($150-230) including accommodation, food, transport, and activities. Mid-range visitors should budget €260-430 per day. The biggest variable is accommodation — book 2-3 months ahead for the best rates.

### Do I need to book attractions in advance in Paris?

Yes, absolutely. The Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and Musée d'Orsay all require timed-entry reservations in 2026. Walk-up tickets sell out daily, especially April-October. Book at least 1-2 weeks ahead, or the morning of your visit at the latest.

### What's the best time of year to visit Paris?

April-June and September-October offer the best combination of mild weather (16-23°C), manageable crowds, and outdoor café season. July-August are hot and tourist-heavy. December is magical with Christmas markets but cold (5-8°C).
