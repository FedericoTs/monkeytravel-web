# Bangkok 5-Day Itinerary: The Practical Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Five days in Bangkok is the sweet spot. Enough time to hit the temples and floating markets that everyone talks about, plus enough slack to get lost in a Chinatown alley at midnight eating crab omelets from a wok the size of a satellite dish. Bangkok rewards both planning and spontaneity — but it punishes tourists who don't understand the transit system.

This itinerary is built on real BTS/MRT connections, actual 2026 prices, and honest timing that accounts for Bangkok's heat and traffic. No "just grab a tuk-tuk" — those are fun but unreliable. You need the Skytrain, the river boats, and the knowledge of when to walk and when to absolutely not walk.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Around — BTS, MRT & River Boats

Bangkok's public transit is cheap, air-conditioned, and gets you past the city's legendary traffic jams. Learn these three systems and you'll move faster than any taxi.

**BTS Skytrain** — The elevated train. Two lines (Sukhumvit and Silom) covering the modern city center. Runs 5:15 AM to midnight.
- **Single rides:** ฿17-62 ($0.50-1.75) depending on distance
- **Rabbit Card:** Rechargeable transit card, ฿100 deposit + ฿100 minimum load. Get one at any BTS station. Saves time vs. buying single-ride tokens.

**MRT (Metro)** — The underground subway. Connects with BTS at several stations. Runs 6:00 AM to midnight.
- **Single rides:** ฿17-42 ($0.50-1.20)
- **Uses a separate fare system** from BTS — your Rabbit Card won't work on MRT. Buy MRT tokens at station machines, or get a separate MRT card.

**Chao Phraya Express Boats** — River boats running north-south along the Chao Phraya River. The cheapest and most scenic way to reach Grand Palace, Wat Arun, and Chinatown.
- **Orange flag boats:** ฿16 ($0.45) flat fare. Most useful for tourists. Run every 5-20 minutes.
- **Blue flag (tourist boat):** ฿60 ($1.70) for a day pass with hop-on/hop-off. Includes audio commentary.
- **Key piers:** Sathorn (connects to BTS Saphan Taksin), Tha Tien (Wat Pho), Tha Chang (Grand Palace), Wang Lang (across from Wat Arun)

**Grab** — Southeast Asia's Uber. Use it for areas not covered by BTS/MRT, especially at night. A 15-minute ride costs ฿80-150 ($2.30-4.30). Always use Grab over street taxis to avoid meter scams.

### Airport to City Center

**From Suvarnabhumi (BKK):**
- **Airport Rail Link (ARL):** 30 minutes to Phaya Thai BTS station, ฿45 ($1.30). Fast, reliable, air-conditioned. The best option for most travelers.
- **Grab/Taxi:** 45-90 minutes depending on traffic, ฿250-400 ($7-11.50). Add ฿50 airport surcharge + tolls (~฿75). Only worth it late at night or with heavy luggage.

**From Don Mueang (DMK):**
- **A1/A2 Bus:** 40-60 minutes to BTS Mo Chit or MRT Chatuchak, ฿30 ($0.85). Cheap but can be crowded.
- **Grab/Taxi:** 30-75 minutes, ฿200-350 ($5.70-10). Traffic on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road can be brutal during rush hours.

### Budget Breakdown

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hotel/night | ฿500-1,500 ($14-43) | ฿2,500-5,000 ($71-143) | ฿8,000+ ($229+) |
| Food/day | ฿300-600 ($8.50-17) | ฿800-1,500 ($23-43) | ฿3,000+ ($86+) |
| Transport/day | ฿100-250 ($2.85-7) | ฿250-500 ($7-14) | ฿800+ ($23+) |
| Activities/day | ฿200-500 ($5.70-14) | ฿500-1,500 ($14-43) | ฿3,000+ ($86+) |
| **Daily Total** | **$31-81** | **$115-243** | **$424+** |

Bangkok is one of the cheapest major cities in the world for travelers. A pad thai costs $1.50. A Singha beer at a street stall is $1.70. A full Thai massage runs $8-12. Your money goes absurdly far here.

### Weather & What to Wear

Bangkok is hot year-round. Average temperature: 30-35°C (86-95°F). The humidity is relentless.

- **Cool season (Nov-Feb):** Best time to visit. 25-32°C, lower humidity, rare rain.
- **Hot season (Mar-May):** Brutal. 35-40°C. Locals stay inside during midday.
- **Rainy season (Jun-Oct):** Afternoon downpours (usually 1-2 hours), then it clears. Still very warm.

**Pack:** Lightweight, breathable clothing. Shoes you can slip on/off easily (you remove shoes at every temple). Sunscreen. A small umbrella for surprise rain. A light scarf or shawl for temple dress codes (shoulders and knees must be covered).

## Day 1: Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun & Khaosan Road

### Morning: Grand Palace & Wat Phra Kaew (8:30 AM)

Get here early. By 10:00 AM, the tour buses arrive and the courtyards become a sea of umbrellas. The **Grand Palace** complex has been the ceremonial heart of Thailand since 1782, and **Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha)** inside it is the most sacred Buddhist temple in the country.

- **Entry:** ฿500 ($14.30). Includes Wat Phra Kaew. This is the most expensive attraction in Bangkok — everything else is cheaper.
- **Hours:** 8:30 AM - 3:30 PM daily (last entry 3:00 PM)
- **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Dress code:** Strictly enforced. Long pants or skirt below the knee, covered shoulders. No sandals. They rent cover-ups at the entrance if needed (฿200 deposit).

**Getting there:** BTS to Saphan Taksin, then Chao Phraya Express Boat to Tha Chang pier. 10-minute walk from the pier.

The level of detail in the architecture is staggering — every surface of the temple complex is encrusted with gold leaf, colored glass, and ceramic tiles. The Emerald Buddha itself is only 66 cm tall and sits atop a towering golden altar. You can't photograph it inside the main chapel.

### Late Morning: Wat Pho (10:30 AM)

Walk 10 minutes south from the Grand Palace to **Wat Pho**, home of the 46-meter-long Reclining Buddha. The soles of its feet — 5 meters wide and inlaid with mother-of-pearl depicting 108 auspicious symbols — are worth the visit alone.

- **Entry:** ฿300 ($8.60). Includes a free water bottle.
- **Hours:** 8:00 AM - 6:30 PM daily
- **Time needed:** 45-60 minutes

Wat Pho is also the birthplace of traditional Thai massage. The on-site massage school offers treatments in open-air pavilions.

- **Thai massage:** ฿300 ($8.60) for 30 minutes, ฿480 ($13.70) for 60 minutes
- **Foot massage:** ฿300 ($8.60) for 30 minutes

Yes, a legitimate Thai massage at the most famous temple in Bangkok costs less than a cocktail in Manhattan. Get one after a morning of walking.

### Lunch: Tha Tien Area (12:00 PM)

Before crossing the river, eat near the Tha Tien pier.

- **Pa Aew** (across from Wat Pho): Legendary pad thai cart. ฿50-80 ($1.40-2.30). Cash only. Look for the crowd.
- **Err Urban Rustic Thai** (on Maha Rat Road): Elevated Thai street food in a restored shophouse. Drinking vinegars, laab, and grilled meats. ฿200-400 ($5.70-11.50) per dish.
- **Tha Tien market stalls:** Grab a mango sticky rice (฿60-80/$1.70-2.30) and eat it by the river.

### Afternoon: Wat Arun (1:30 PM)

Take the cross-river ferry from Tha Tien pier to **Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn)**. The ferry costs ฿4 ($0.11) — possibly the best value in all of Bangkok tourism.

Wat Arun's 82-meter central prang (Khmer-style tower) is encrusted with colorful Chinese porcelain and seashells. You can climb partway up the steep stairs for a panoramic view of the river and the Grand Palace across the water.

- **Entry:** ฿100 ($2.85)
- **Hours:** 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM daily
- **Time needed:** 45-60 minutes
- **Best photo op:** From the Tha Tien side of the river at sunset (come back later, or photograph it from your dinner spot)

### Late Afternoon: Rest & Recharge (3:00 PM)

Bangkok's midday heat is no joke, especially after a morning of temple-hopping. Head back to your hotel for a shower and rest. Take the Chao Phraya Express Boat south to Sathorn pier, then BTS to your hotel area.

### Evening: Khaosan Road (7:00 PM)

Love it or hate it — Khaosan Road is a Bangkok rite of passage. This 400-meter backpacker strip transforms at night into a buzzing carnival of street food, cheap beer, and sensory overload.

**Getting there:** Grab from anywhere (฿60-120), or Chao Phraya Express Boat to Phra Athit pier and walk 5 minutes.

**What to eat and drink:**
- **Pad thai from a wok cart:** ฿50-80 ($1.40-2.30)
- **Mango sticky rice:** ฿60-80 ($1.70-2.30)
- **Scorpion on a stick** (if you dare): ฿50-100 ($1.40-2.85)
- **Bucket cocktails:** ฿150-200 ($4.30-5.70). The backpacker special — a small bucket of Thai whiskey, Red Bull, and soda. Proceed with caution.
- **Singha/Chang/Leo beer** from 7-Eleven: ฿40-60 ($1.15-1.70). Half the price of bars.

Wander into the sois (side streets) for better food at lower prices. **Soi Rambuttri**, running parallel to Khaosan, has a more relaxed vibe with open-air restaurants and live music.

---

## Day 2: Chatuchak Weekend Market, Jim Thompson House & Sukhumvit Food Tour

### Morning: Chatuchak Weekend Market (9:00 AM)

**Chatuchak (JJ Market)** is one of the largest outdoor markets in the world: 15,000+ stalls spread across 35 acres, organized into 27 sections. It's open Saturday and Sunday (and a smaller version on Fridays). If your Day 2 doesn't fall on a weekend, swap this day with another.

- **Hours:** Saturday-Sunday, 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (some stalls open Friday evening)
- **Entry:** Free
- **Getting there:** BTS to Mo Chit or MRT to Chatuchak Park. Exit 1 drops you right at the entrance.

**Navigation tips:**
- Grab a free map at the information booth near Gate 2
- Sections 2-4: Vintage and secondhand clothing
- Sections 5-6: Art and home décor
- Section 7: Antiques and collectibles
- Sections 17-19: Ceramics, pottery, Thai crafts
- Section 26: Used books

**What to buy:**
- Thai silk scarves: ฿200-500 ($5.70-14.30)
- Handmade coconut oil soaps: ฿50-100 ($1.40-2.85)
- Vintage Thai boxing shorts: ฿150-300 ($4.30-8.60)
- Custom-made leather goods: ฿500-2,000 ($14.30-57)

**Negotiating:** Expected and encouraged at Chatuchak. Start at 60-70% of the asking price and meet in the middle. Don't haggle for items under ฿100 — it's unnecessary. Always smile — aggressive bargaining is culturally off-putting.

**Eat inside the market:**
- **Viva 8** (Section 8): Famous coconut ice cream, ฿40 ($1.15)
- **Pad thai stalls** near sections 24-26: ฿50-70 ($1.40-2)
- **Fresh coconut water:** ฿30-50 ($0.85-1.40). You'll need the hydration.

### Afternoon: Jim Thompson House (1:30 PM)

After the market, take BTS from Mo Chit to National Stadium (6 stops). Walk 5 minutes to the **Jim Thompson House** — a beautifully preserved teak compound built by the American silk entrepreneur who single-handedly revived the Thai silk industry in the 1950s, then vanished without a trace in Malaysia in 1967.

- **Entry:** ฿200 ($5.70). Guided tours only (included with entry, every 20 minutes). Tours in English and Thai.
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM daily
- **Time needed:** 60-90 minutes

The six traditional Thai houses are filled with his art collection — Southeast Asian antiques, Chinese porcelain, and Burmese sculptures. The gardens are a rare green oasis in central Bangkok.

### Late Afternoon: Siam & MBK (3:30 PM)

You're already in the Siam area — Bangkok's shopping epicenter. If you want air-conditioned retail therapy:

- **MBK Center** (BTS National Stadium): 8 floors of stalls selling electronics, clothing, phone cases, and accessories. Feels like a vertical street market. Great for cheap phone accessories and tailored clothing. Bargaining expected.
- **Siam Paragon** (BTS Siam): The upscale counterpart. Luxury brands, an excellent food court in the basement (฿60-120/$1.70-3.40 per dish — seriously good and cheap), and Southeast Asia's largest aquarium, **Sea Life Bangkok Ocean World** (฿990/$28.30, skip unless traveling with kids).

### Evening: Sukhumvit Food Tour (6:00 PM)

Head to **BTS Phrom Phong or Thong Lo** for Sukhumvit's evening food scene. The sois (side streets) between Sukhumvit Soi 23 and Soi 55 (Thonglor) are packed with restaurants from every cuisine — Thai, Japanese, Korean, Middle Eastern, Italian.

**Walking food route (self-guided):**

1. **Soi 38 Night Market** (remnants near BTS Thong Lo): Grilled satay skewers ฿10-20 each ($0.30-0.57), boat noodles ฿40-60 ($1.15-1.70)
2. **Pee Aor Tom Yum Goong** (Soi 20, accessible from BTS Asok): The most famous tom yum in Bangkok. Rich, creamy, packed with river prawns. ฿150-250 ($4.30-7.15)
3. **Thonglor Soi 13:** Walk this strip for a mix of Thai restaurants and craft cocktail bars. End the night at **Soi 11** near Nana for rooftop bars and nightlife.

## Day 3: Floating Market & Maeklong Railway Market

This is a day trip outside the city. You'll need to leave early and won't return until late afternoon.

### Getting There — Two Options

**Option A: Amphawa Floating Market (recommended)**
A more authentic, less touristy floating market that operates Friday-Sunday evenings. If your Day 3 falls on Fri-Sun, choose Amphawa.

**Option B: Damnoen Saduak Floating Market**
The famous one from every postcard. Touristy but photogenic. Open daily, busiest 7:00-11:00 AM. Better for weekday visitors.

**Getting to Damnoen Saduak + Maeklong (combined day trip):**

- **Minivan from Victory Monument:** ฿80-100 ($2.30-2.85) each way to Damnoen Saduak. Departs from 6:00 AM. BTS to Victory Monument, then find the minivan stand on the south side. Journey: 90 minutes.
- **Organized tour:** ฿800-1,500 ($23-43) per person. Includes hotel pickup, both markets, and sometimes a coconut farm or salt farm stop. Book through your hotel or Klook/GetYourGuide. Saves logistics headaches.

### Morning: Maeklong Railway Market (7:30 AM if self-guided)

Start with **Maeklong Railway Market (Talat Rom Hub)** — also called the "umbrella pulldown market." Vendors set up stalls directly on active train tracks. When a train comes (8 times daily), they calmly pull back their awnings and products as the train passes inches from the goods. It's surreal.

- **Entry:** Free
- **Train times from Bangkok:** The morning trains are the most reliable. Check schedules — roughly 6:20, 8:30, 9:00 AM and 11:10, 11:30 AM, 2:30, 3:30, 5:40 PM.
- **Time needed:** 30-60 minutes. Time your visit to watch at least one train pass through.

**What to buy at Maeklong:** Fresh seafood (grilled to order), tropical fruits, coconut sugar candy, dried squid. This is a working local market, not a tourist setup — prices are fair.

### Late Morning/Afternoon: Damnoen Saduak Floating Market (10:00 AM)

From Maeklong, it's a 30-minute drive to **Damnoen Saduak**. If you arranged a tour, this transfer is included. If going solo, catch a songthaew (shared pickup truck) for ฿50-80.

The canal-based market features vendors in wooden boats selling pad thai, coconut pancakes, mango sticky rice, fresh fruit, and souvenirs. You can walk along the canal paths or rent a boat:

- **Long-tail boat ride:** ฿200-300 ($5.70-8.60) per person for 30 minutes through the canal network. Negotiate before boarding.
- **Paddle boat:** ฿150 ($4.30) per person for a shorter, calmer experience.

**Haggling is expected** — vendors start high. Pad thai from a boat should be ฿50-80 ($1.40-2.30), not the ฿150 some vendors quote to foreigners.

**Pro tip:** Walk past the first few rows of stalls at the main entrance. Deeper into the market, prices drop and crowds thin. The vendors at the edges sell better food and less trinket junk.

### Amphawa Alternative (If Fri-Sun)

**Amphawa Floating Market** operates 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM on Fri-Sun. The evening atmosphere — canal-side seafood stalls lit by string lights, firefly boat tours after dark — is genuinely magical.

- **Getting there:** Minivan from Victory Monument, ฿70-100 ($2-2.85), 90 minutes
- **Grilled river prawns:** ฿100-200 ($2.85-5.70) per plate — Amphawa's signature dish
- **Firefly boat tour:** ฿60-100 ($1.70-2.85) per person. Runs after dark (7:00-9:00 PM). Best from June to November.

### Return to Bangkok (3:00-5:00 PM)

Minivans return to Victory Monument throughout the afternoon. You'll arrive tired and dusty — the perfect state for a foot massage at any shop near your hotel (฿200-300/$5.70-8.60 for 60 minutes).

---

## Day 4: Chinatown, Yaowarat Street Food, Rooftop Bars & Asiatique

### Morning: Chinatown by Day (10:00 AM)

Bangkok's Chinatown (**Yaowarat**) is one of the oldest and largest in the world, founded in 1782 when Chinese merchants were relocated to make room for the Grand Palace. During the day, it's a labyrinth of gold shops, traditional Chinese medicine stores, temples, and narrow alleyways.

**Getting there:** MRT to Wat Mangkon station (opened 2019, right in the heart of Chinatown) or Chao Phraya Express Boat to Ratchawong pier.

**Daytime highlights:**
- **Wat Mangkon Kamalawat:** The most important Chinese Buddhist temple in Bangkok. Free entry. Incense and gold everywhere.
- **Sampeng Lane (Soi Wanit 1):** A narrow, 1-km walking street packed with wholesale goods — fabrics, toys, accessories, trinkets. Everything is cheap. Allow 30-45 minutes.
- **Talat Mai (New Market):** Chinatown's oldest fresh market. Dried herbs, mushrooms, spices, preserved plums, and Chinese sausages. Even if you're not buying, the atmosphere is fantastic.

### Lunch: Yaowarat Daytime Eats (12:00 PM)

- **Nai Ek Roll Noodle** (Yaowarat Road): Legendary rolled rice noodles with pork. ฿60-80 ($1.70-2.30). Has been here for decades.
- **Jek Pui Curry Rice** (Charoen Krung Road): Thai-Chinese curry over rice. Pick 2-3 curries over steamed rice for ฿60-80 ($1.70-2.30). The duck is exceptional.
- **Tang Jai Yoo** (Yaowarat Soi 11): Classic dim sum. ฿30-60 ($0.85-1.70) per dish. Order the pork buns and har gow (shrimp dumplings).

### Afternoon: Flower Market & Chill (2:00 PM)

Walk 15 minutes west from Yaowarat to **Pak Khlong Talat (Flower Market)** — Bangkok's largest flower market. Jasmine garlands, orchids, roses, and lotus flowers are piled floor-to-ceiling. It peaks at night and early morning (for wholesale), but the afternoon is still vibrant and far less crowded.

- **Entry:** Free
- **A jasmine garland:** ฿20-40 ($0.57-1.15). Buy one and hang it from your neck like locals do.

After the flower market, retreat to your hotel to rest before the big evening ahead. Chinatown at night is a completely different experience from daytime.

### Evening: Yaowarat Street Food Marathon (5:30 PM)

This is the culinary highlight of your entire trip. When the sun sets, Yaowarat Road transforms into one of the greatest street food destinations on earth. Stalls, carts, and shophouse restaurants fire up their woks, grills, and steamers. The smoke, the sizzle, the neon of Chinese signage — it's electric.

**The essential Yaowarat food crawl:**

1. **T&K Seafood** (Yaowarat Road): The famous restaurant with green tables spilling onto the sidewalk. Grilled river prawns (฿200-400/$5.70-11.50 depending on size), crab omelets, and steamed fish. Come early — the line gets long by 7 PM.
2. **Guay jub (rolled rice noodle soup)** from any cart with a line: Peppery broth with pork offal. ฿60-80 ($1.70-2.30). A Chinatown staple.
3. **Ba mee giaw (egg noodle with wontons)** — look for stalls with red BBQ pork hanging in the window: ฿50-70 ($1.40-2).
4. **Mango sticky rice** for dessert: ฿60-80 ($1.70-2.30). The Chinatown versions use extra-ripe nam dok mai mangoes.
5. **Kanom buang (Thai crispy crepe):** ฿10-20 ($0.30-0.57) each. Crunchy taco-shaped shells filled with sweet or savory meringue and shredded coconut.

Budget for the full food crawl: ฿400-700 ($11.50-20) per person. You will be very full.

### Late Evening: Rooftop Bar (8:30 PM)

After the street food marathon, clean up and head to a rooftop bar. Bangkok has more (and cheaper) rooftop bars than any other city in Asia.

- **Sky Bar at Lebua (Silom):** The famous one from The Hangover Part II. BTS Saphan Taksin, then a short walk. Drinks ฿500-800 ($14.30-23). Dress code enforced (no shorts, no sandals). The view of the river bend is spectacular, but drinks are pricey.
- **Octave Rooftop Lounge (Thonglor):** BTS Thong Lo. 45th-49th floors of the Marriott. Better value. Cocktails ฿350-500 ($10-14.30). Three-level terrace with 360-degree views.
- **Vertigo & Moon Bar (Silom):** 61st floor of the Banyan Tree. Dramatic open-air rooftop. Cocktails ฿450-650 ($12.85-18.60). No railing — just the sky and the city below.
- **Budget option — Roof bars on Khaosan Road:** ฿120-200 ($3.40-5.70) cocktails with passable views. Zero dress code.

### Optional: Asiatique the Riverfront (Alternative Evening)

If rooftop bars aren't your thing, **Asiatique** is an open-air night market and entertainment complex on the Chao Phraya River. Free shuttle boat from Sathorn pier (BTS Saphan Taksin), running 4:00-11:30 PM.

- 1,500+ shops and 40+ restaurants in converted riverside warehouses
- **Calypso Cabaret:** Lady-boy cabaret show, ฿1,200 ($34.30). Sequins, lip-syncing, and impressive production values.
- **Muay Thai Live:** Theatrical Muay Thai performance, ฿1,200-1,800 ($34.30-51.40)
- Food prices are higher than street stalls but lower than malls. Expect ฿100-250 ($2.85-7.15) per dish.

## Day 5: Ayutthaya Day Trip OR Modern Bangkok

You have a choice on your last day. Both options are excellent — pick based on your interests.

### Option A: Ayutthaya Day Trip

**Ayutthaya** was the capital of the Kingdom of Siam from 1351 to 1767, when the Burmese army burned it to the ground. The ruins — crumbling temples, headless Buddhas, tree-wrapped stone heads — are haunting and UNESCO-listed. It's 80 km north of Bangkok.

#### Getting There

- **Train from Hua Lamphong (Bangkok Railway Station):** ฿20-345 ($0.57-9.85) depending on class. Third class costs ฿20 — yes, twenty baht for a 90-minute train ride. No AC, wooden seats, open windows, incredible vibes. Second class with AC: ฿245 ($7). First class: ฿345 ($9.85). Trains depart roughly every hour from 4:20 AM.
- **Minivan from Victory Monument:** ฿60-80 ($1.70-2.30). 90 minutes. Faster but less atmospheric.
- **Private tour:** ฿2,000-4,000 ($57-114) per person. Includes transport, guide, lunch, and temple entries. Book via Klook or your hotel.

**Getting there update:** In 2026, many trains now depart from **Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal (Bang Sue Grand Station)** instead of Hua Lamphong. Check schedules at the station or the State Railway of Thailand website.

#### The Temples (9:30 AM - 3:00 PM)

Rent a bicycle at the train station for ฿50-100 ($1.40-2.85) per day. The ruins are spread across an island and cycling is the best way to explore. Alternatively, hire a tuk-tuk driver for a 4-hour temple tour: ฿300-500 ($8.60-14.30).

**Must-see temples:**

1. **Wat Mahathat:** The iconic Buddha head entwined in tree roots. This is the image that sells Ayutthaya to the world. Entry: ฿50 ($1.40).
2. **Wat Phra Si Sanphet:** Three massive chedis (stupas) that were once the royal palace temple. Entry: ฿50 ($1.40).
3. **Wat Chaiwatthanaram:** The most photogenic temple in Ayutthaya, modeled after Angkor Wat. Riverside setting. Entry: ฿50 ($1.40). Best at sunset, but you'll likely visit midday.
4. **Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon:** A huge reclining Buddha and a towering chedi you can climb. Entry: ฿20 ($0.57).

**Combined temple pass:** ฿220 ($6.30) for 6 major temples. Worth it if you visit 4 or more.

#### Lunch in Ayutthaya

- **Roti Sai Mai stalls** near the old city: Ayutthaya's famous cotton candy wrapped in roti flatbread. ฿20-40 ($0.57-1.15). Weird and wonderful.
- **Boat noodles** at the riverside market: ฿15-20 ($0.43-0.57) per tiny bowl. They're intentionally small — you eat 5-8 bowls. It's a thing.
- **Lung Lek** (near Wat Mahathat): Grilled river fish with spicy salad. ฿80-150 ($2.30-4.30).

#### Return to Bangkok (3:00-4:00 PM)

Train or minivan back. You'll arrive by 5:00-6:00 PM.

### Option B: Modern Bangkok — Siam, Spa & Shopping

If you want a relaxed final day without early alarms and long commutes:

#### Morning: Lumphini Park (8:00 AM)

**Lumphini Park** is Bangkok's Central Park — 142 acres of green space in the middle of the city. Join the locals for a morning walk, jog, or tai chi session. Watch for **monitor lizards** — 2-meter water monitors live in the park's lakes and wander the paths. They're harmless but startling.

- **Entry:** Free
- **Getting there:** MRT Lumphini or BTS Sala Daeng
- **Time needed:** 45-60 minutes

#### Late Morning: Thai Massage & Spa (10:00 AM)

Treat yourself to a proper spa experience. Bangkok has everything from ฿200 street-side massage shops to luxury hotel spas.

- **Terminal 21 food court** (BTS Asok): Themed floors representing different cities. The 5th-floor food court has insanely cheap, high-quality Thai food: ฿35-60 ($1-1.70) per dish. This is not a typo — it's subsidized to attract foot traffic.
- **ICONSIAM** (Chao Phraya west bank, free shuttle from BTS Saphan Taksin): The most spectacular mall in Southeast Asia. The ground floor, **SookSiam**, recreates a floating market indoors with dishes from all 77 Thai provinces.

## How Much Do 5 Days in Bangkok Cost?

Realistic budget for 5 days, per person:

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Accommodation (5 nights) | $70-215 | $355-715 |
| Food (5 days) | $43-85 | $115-215 |
| Transport (5 days + day trips) | $20-50 | $50-100 |
| Activities & entries | $30-75 | $75-215 |
| Massages & shopping | $25-50 | $85-285 |
| **Total** | **$188-475** | **$680-1,530** |

**Money-saving tips:**
- Eat street food for at least one meal a day — it's not just cheaper, it's often the best food in the city
- Skip taxis for anything near a BTS/MRT station. Transit is 10x cheaper and often faster.
- Drink 7-Eleven beer (฿40-60) instead of bar beer (฿150-250)
- Get massages at neighborhood shops, not hotel spas. Same techniques, one-third the price.
- Buy a ฿200 folding fan from any market — you'll use it constantly and it's a practical souvenir
- Temple entries are cheap individually (฿50-300), but they add up. Prioritize Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun. Many neighborhood temples are free.

## FAQ

### Is 5 days enough for Bangkok?

Five days is ideal for a first visit. You'll cover the major temples, markets, Chinatown, a floating market day trip, and either Ayutthaya or a relaxed spa/shopping day. For travelers who want to add Kanchanaburi (Bridge over the River Kwai), Khao Yai National Park, or extend into the islands, budget 7-10 days total in Thailand.

### What is the best area to stay in Bangkok?

**Sukhumvit (Sois 1-55)** offers the best balance: BTS stations everywhere, restaurants at every price point, nightlife, and easy access to the rest of the city. **Silom/Sathorn** is great for business travelers and Chao Phraya River access. **Khaosan Road** area is budget-friendly but far from transit. For a first visit, stay near **BTS Asok, Phrom Phong, or Thong Lo**.

### Is Bangkok safe?

Very safe for tourists. Violent crime against visitors is rare. Common scams to watch for: tuk-tuk drivers offering "free" tours that end at gem shops, taxi drivers refusing to use the meter, and the "Grand Palace is closed today" lie (it's not — they want to redirect you to a shop). Use Grab instead of street taxis, and walk into any temple that someone tells you is closed.

### What should I not do in Bangkok?

- Don't disrespect the monarchy — it's a criminal offense in Thailand (lèse-majesté laws)
- Don't touch anyone's head — the head is considered the most sacred part of the body
- Don't point your feet at people or Buddha images — feet are considered the lowest part of the body
- Don't wear shoes inside temples (or most homes and some shops)
- Don't buy fake goods at MBK expecting to bring them through customs — they can be confiscated

### When is the best time to visit Bangkok?

November through February — the "cool" season (still 25-32°C but with lower humidity and almost no rain). December-January is peak tourist season with the best weather. Avoid mid-April (Songkran) unless you want to participate in the massive water fight across the entire city — it's either the highlight of your trip or the worst day, depending on your tolerance for being soaked by strangers.
