# New York 5-Day Itinerary: The Practical Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Five days in New York City is the sweet spot. It's enough to cover the icons without sprinting between them, enough to eat your way through multiple neighborhoods, and enough to stumble onto the block parties, jazz clubs, and hole-in-the-wall dumpling shops that make this city what it is.

This itinerary is organized by neighborhood clusters so you're not bouncing between boroughs on the subway every hour. Every price, every subway route, and every restaurant recommendation is current as of 2026. No filler, no "just wander" advice — you have five days and they should count.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Around

The NYC subway runs 24/7 and is the fastest way to get almost anywhere in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Forget taxis during rush hour — the subway will beat them every time.

- **OMNY tap-to-pay:** Just tap your contactless credit card, phone, or smartwatch at any turnstile. After 12 paid rides in a week, the rest are free (automatic fare capping). No need to buy a MetroCard anymore.
- **Single ride:** $2.90
- **Weekly equivalent (via OMNY cap):** $34.80 (12 rides, then free for the rest of the week, Monday-Sunday)
- **Old-school MetroCard:** Still works. $34.00 for a 7-day unlimited pass. Buy one at any station kiosk.

**From JFK:** The AirTrain to Jamaica Station ($8.50) + subway ($2.90) takes about 60-75 minutes to Midtown. Total: $11.40. Taxis have a flat rate of $70 + tolls and tip (usually $85-95 total). Uber/Lyft runs $55-90 depending on demand.

**From Newark (EWR):** NJ Transit + AirTrain to Penn Station costs about $15.25 and takes 45-60 minutes. Taxis run $80-100 + tolls.

**From LaGuardia (LGA):** The LaGuardia AirTrain (opened 2025) connects to Mets-Willets Point station on the 7 train. Total cost $11.40, about 40-50 minutes to Midtown.

### Tipping Culture

Tipping is not optional in New York:
- **Restaurants:** 18-20% on the pre-tax total
- **Bars:** $1-2 per drink
- **Taxis/rideshare:** 15-20%
- **Hotel housekeeping:** $3-5 per night

### Budget Breakdown

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hotel/night | $120-200 | $250-400 | $500+ |
| Food/day | $40-65 | $80-140 | $200+ |
| Transport/day | $6-12 | $15-30 | $50+ |
| Activities/day | $20-40 | $50-90 | $150+ |
| **Daily Total** | **$186-317** | **$395-660** | **$900+** |

**Important:** These prices are per person. New York is expensive, but eating like a local (pizza slices, dollar dumplings, food trucks) can keep food costs under $50/day without sacrificing quality.

## Day 1: Midtown Manhattan — The Greatest Hits

### Morning: Top of the Rock (9:00 AM)

Start high. **Top of the Rock** at Rockefeller Center gives you the best panoramic view of Manhattan because you can see the Empire State Building *in* the view (you can't see it from the Empire State Building itself).

- **Tickets:** $43 adult (book timed entry at topoftherocknyc.com)
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - midnight daily
- **Time needed:** 45-60 minutes

**Tip:** Book the first entry at 9:00 AM. The light is beautiful, and you'll share the observation deck with a fraction of the midday crowd. The outdoor terrace on the 70th floor is the money shot.

After descending, walk through **Rockefeller Plaza** itself. If you're visiting between October and April, the famous ice rink will be there. Any time of year, pop into the lobby of 30 Rock to see the Art Deco murals.

### Late Morning: Times Square & Broadway (10:30 AM)

Walk 5 minutes north to **Times Square**. Yes, it's overwhelming and absurdly commercial. Spend 20-30 minutes absorbing the sensory overload, then get out. Seriously — you've seen it, you don't need to linger.

**Worth doing:** Stop by the **TKTS booth** (under the red steps at 47th & Broadway) to grab discounted same-day Broadway tickets — 20-50% off. The booth opens at 10:00 AM for matinees and 3:00 PM for evening shows. The app **TodayTix** also has last-minute deals.

Broadway ticket prices in 2026:
- **Budget option:** Rush/lottery tickets $30-45 (available day-of through show apps)
- **TKTS discount:** $65-110
- **Full price:** $100-250+ depending on the show

### Midday: Central Park South Entrance (12:00 PM)

Walk north 10 minutes to enter **Central Park** at the southeast corner (59th St & 5th Ave). The park is 843 acres, so don't try to see it all. Hit these spots in a northward walk:

1. **The Pond** — immediately inside the entrance, a surprisingly tranquil lake
2. **Bethesda Fountain & Terrace** — the iconic centerpiece (10-minute walk in)
3. **The Lake & Bow Bridge** — the most photographed bridge in Central Park
4. **Strawberry Fields** — John Lennon memorial, near 72nd St West Side

This route covers about 1.5 miles and takes 60-90 minutes at a relaxed pace.

**Lunch in the Park:** Grab a hot dog or pretzel from a cart ($3-5) for the classic experience. Or exit on the West Side at 72nd and walk to **Levain Bakery** (351 Amsterdam Ave) for their famous 6-ounce chocolate chip walnut cookie ($5.50) — one of the best cookies in the city.

### Afternoon: The Metropolitan Museum of Art (2:00 PM)

Enter Central Park's east side at 82nd Street for **The Met** — one of the greatest museums on Earth. With 2 million+ works across 17 acres of galleries, you need a plan.

- **Tickets:** $30 adult (suggested admission for NY residents — pay what you wish)
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM (until 9:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays)
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours minimum

**The efficient route:** Start with the Egyptian Wing (Temple of Dendur is unmissable), then European Paintings (Vermeer, Rembrandt, Monet), then the American Wing. If you have time, the Rooftop Garden (open April-October) has cocktails and a skyline view.

**Pro tip:** Friday and Saturday evenings are less crowded and have a wonderful atmosphere with live music in the Great Hall Balcony Bar.

### Evening: Midtown Dinner & Broadway

For dinner before a show, skip the tourist traps near Times Square. Instead:

- **Joe's Pizza** (7 Carmine St, but the Midtown location at 150 E 14th St is less crowded): Classic NYC slice, $3.75. This is the benchmark.
- **Los Tacos No. 1** (Chelsea Market or Times Square): Excellent tacos, $4.50-5.50 each. Lines move fast.
- **Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong** (1 E 32nd St): Korean BBQ in Koreatown, $30-45 per person. Fun and delicious.
- **Quality Italian** (57 W 57th St): Upscale pre-theater option, $40-70 per person.

If you got Broadway tickets earlier, curtain is typically 7:00 PM (matinees) or 8:00 PM (evening). Arrive 20 minutes early.

## Day 2: Lower Manhattan — History, Icons & the Brooklyn Bridge

### Morning: Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island (8:30 AM)

Take the subway to **Bowling Green** (4/5 trains) or **Whitehall St-South Ferry** (R/W trains). Ferries depart from **Battery Park** starting at 8:30 AM.

- **Reserve tickets:** Buy at statueofliberty.org — these sell out weeks in advance
- **Ferry + Liberty Island + Ellis Island:** $24.50 adult
- **Ferry + Pedestal access:** $24.50 (same price, but limited — book early)
- **Crown access:** $24.50 (extremely limited, book 2-3 months ahead)
- **Time needed:** 3-4 hours for both islands

**Strategy:** Take the first ferry at 8:30 AM to beat the crowds. Spend 60-90 minutes on Liberty Island, then take the next ferry to Ellis Island. The immigration museum there is genuinely moving — don't skip it.

**Alternative:** If tickets are sold out, the **Staten Island Ferry** is free and passes right by the Statue of Liberty. Great photos, zero wait. It departs from Whitehall Terminal every 30 minutes.

### Midday: Wall Street & Financial District (12:30 PM)

Walk north from Battery Park through the Financial District:

1. **Charging Bull** (Bowling Green) — the iconic bronze bull statue, 2 minutes from the ferry terminal
2. **Wall Street & the New York Stock Exchange** — the facade is impressive; you can't go inside, but the photo op is worth the 5-minute walk
3. **Federal Hall** — where George Washington was inaugurated. Free entry.
4. **Trinity Church** — a peaceful 18th-century church surrounded by skyscrapers

This walking loop takes 30-45 minutes.

**Lunch:** Head to **Stone Street**, a cobblestoned pedestrian alley lined with restaurants. **Adrienne's Pizzabar** does excellent thin-crust pizza ($14-18). In warm weather, the entire street becomes an outdoor dining room.

### Afternoon: 9/11 Memorial & Museum (2:00 PM)

Walk 10 minutes north to the **9/11 Memorial & Museum**. The twin reflecting pools where the towers stood are open 24/7 and free to visit. The underground museum requires tickets.

- **Museum tickets:** $33 adult (timed entry, book at 911memorial.org)
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - 7:00 PM daily (last entry 5:30 PM)
- **Time needed:** 1.5-2.5 hours

This is an emotionally heavy experience. Allow time and space for it. The Survivor Stairs and the Last Column are particularly powerful.

Afterward, step inside the **Oculus** — the white, wing-shaped transit hub designed by Santiago Calatrava. It's free to walk through and architecturally stunning, even if you're not taking a train.

### Late Afternoon: Brooklyn Bridge Walk (4:30 PM)

Walk east to the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian entrance at **City Hall Park** (near the 4/5/6 at Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station). The walk across takes 30-40 minutes and is one of the great free experiences in the world.

**Tip:** Walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn (not the other direction). The skyline view unfolds in front of you as you cross, and you end up in DUMBO, which is where you want to be for sunset.

### Evening: DUMBO Sunset & Dinner

On the Brooklyn side, walk down to **Main Street Park** and the waterfront for the classic Manhattan skyline view under the bridge. The **Jane's Carousel** (in a glass pavilion on the waterfront) is worth a ride at $2.

For dinner in DUMBO:

- **Juliana's Pizza** (19 Old Fulton St): Coal-fired pizza from the original Patsy Grimaldi. Margherita $24. Often called the best pizza in NYC. Expect a 30-60 minute wait without a reservation.
- **Time Out Market** (55 Water St): Food hall with multiple vendors, $12-20 per dish
- **Celestine** (1 John St): Mediterranean with a stunning waterfront terrace, $50-75 per person

Take the **F train** from York Street or the **A/C** from High Street back to Manhattan.

---

## Day 3: Brooklyn — DUMBO, Williamsburg & Bushwick

### Morning: Brooklyn Flea & DUMBO (10:00 AM)

If it's a weekend, start at the **Brooklyn Flea** (80 Pearl St, DUMBO) — vintage clothing, handmade jewelry, and some of the best food vendors in the city. Open Saturdays and Sundays, 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM.

Walk under the Manhattan Bridge overpass for the iconic **Washington Street** photo (the bridge perfectly framing the Empire State Building between the brick warehouses). This is free and takes 30 seconds.

**Coffee:** **Butler** (40 Water St) for specialty coffee ($5-7) or **Brooklyn Roasting Company** (25 Jay St) for a more relaxed vibe.

### Late Morning: Williamsburg (11:30 AM)

Take the **F train** from York Street to **Marcy Avenue** (one stop on the J/M/Z from the Williamsburg Bridge). Welcome to Brooklyn's most famous neighborhood.

Walk along **Bedford Avenue**, Williamsburg's main strip:

- **Smorgasburg** (Saturdays at Marsha P. Johnson State Park, 90 Kent Ave, April-October): The largest outdoor food market in America. 100+ vendors, everything from ramen burgers to Thai rolled ice cream. $5-15 per item.
- **Artists & Fleas** (70 N 7th St): Indoor market with local artists and designers. Open weekends.
- **Rough Trade** (64 N 9th St): Massive independent record store. Even if you don't buy vinyl, the in-store performances are worth checking.

**Lunch options in Williamsburg:**

- **Okonomi** (150 Ainslie St): Japanese breakfast/brunch with a set menu. One of the most unique meals in Brooklyn, $22-28.
- **Los Hermanos** (271 Starr St): Incredible Dominican food, generous portions, $10-16. A local staple.

### Afternoon: Bushwick Street Art (2:00 PM)

Take the **L train** from Bedford Avenue two stops to **Jefferson Street** or **DeKalb Avenue**. Bushwick is NYC's street art capital.

Walk along **Troutman Street**, **Jefferson Street**, and **St. Nicholas Avenue** between Jefferson and DeKalb. The entire area is an open-air gallery — massive murals covering entire building facades. The **Bushwick Collective** (centered around St. Nicholas Ave and Troutman St) curates many of these.

This is completely free. Give yourself 60-90 minutes to wander.

**Coffee break:** **Café Ghia** (24 Irving Ave) is a beautiful Italian-style café in an old pharmacy. Espresso $4, pastries $5-7.

### Evening: Brooklyn Food & Drinks

Head back to Williamsburg for dinner:

- **Peter Luger Steak House** (178 Broadway): NYC's most famous steakhouse since 1887. Cash only, no reservations for parties under 4. Porterhouse for two: $125. Worth it once in your life.
- **Lilia** (567 Union Ave): Missy Robbins' Italian masterpiece. Pasta $24-32. Book weeks ahead on Resy.
- **Llama Inn** (50 Withers St): Peruvian-inspired, beautiful rooftop. $35-55 per person.

For drinks, **Westlight** (111 N 12th St) is a rooftop bar atop the William Vale hotel with panoramic Manhattan views. Cocktails $18-22. Arrive before sunset for the best experience.

## Day 4: Upper West Side, Natural History & Harlem

### Morning: American Museum of Natural History (10:00 AM)

Take the **B or C train** to 81st Street-Museum of Natural History. This museum is so large it has its own subway station.

- **Tickets:** $28 adult (suggested admission for NY residents — pay what you wish). The **Gilder Center** wing (opened 2023) requires a separate timed ticket for the immersive exhibits.
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM - 5:30 PM daily
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours

**Must-see highlights:**
1. **Hayden Planetarium** — the space show in the sphere is extraordinary ($28 with museum admission, or $33 with Gilder Center combo)
2. **Dinosaur Halls** (4th floor) — the Tyrannosaurus and Apatosaurus skeletons are the real thing
3. **Ocean Life Hall** — the 94-foot blue whale model hanging from the ceiling
4. **Gilder Center** — the vivarium and butterfly house are worth the add-on

### Midday: Upper West Side Lunch

The Upper West Side has some of New York's best casual dining:

- **Barney Greengrass** (541 Amsterdam Ave): "The Sturgeon King" since 1908. Smoked fish platters $18-28, bagels with lox $16. A genuine NYC institution. Cash only. Closed Mondays.
- **Jacob's Pickles** (509 Amsterdam Ave): Southern comfort food with insane biscuits. Brunch $16-22.
- **Levain Bakery** (167 W 74th St): The original location. If you missed it on Day 1, grab that legendary cookie now.

### Afternoon: Harlem (2:00 PM)

Take the **A/C/B/D train** uptown to **125th Street**. Harlem is the cultural heart of Black America and one of New York's most vibrant neighborhoods.

Walk along **125th Street** (Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd):
- **Apollo Theater** (253 W 125th St): The legendary venue where Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, and countless others launched their careers. Tour tickets $22-25, or attend **Amateur Night** on Wednesdays ($20-35) for the authentic experience.
- **Studio Museum in Harlem** (144 W 125th St): Dedicated to artists of African descent. Check current exhibitions.
- **Sylvia's** (328 Malcolm X Blvd): The "Queen of Soul Food" since 1962. Fried chicken $18, smothered pork chops $22, cornbread is legendary. Come for lunch to avoid dinner waits.

Walk north to **Strivers' Row** (W 138th-139th St between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Blvds) — stunning turn-of-the-century brownstones. Then head to **Marcus Garvey Park** for a neighborhood vibe far from the tourist trail.

### Evening: Harlem Jazz

Harlem is the birthplace of jazz, and the live scene is still very much alive:

- **Bill's Place** (148 W 133rd St): An intimate speakeasy-style jazz room in a historic brownstone. BYOB, sets at 8:00 and 10:00 PM, $30 per person. Reserve ahead — it seats about 30 people.
- **Minton's** (206 W 118th St): The legendary club where bebop was born, now a refined supper club. No cover for bar seating, $20-35 for table reservations. Live music Thursday-Sunday.
- **Paris Blues** (2021 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd): A no-frills dive bar with free live jazz nightly. $5 minimum drink purchase. The real deal.

**Dinner before jazz:**

- **Vinatería** (2211 Frederick Douglass Blvd): Italian-Latin wine bar with small plates. Beautiful space, $30-50 per person.

---

## Day 5: SoHo, Greenwich Village, Chelsea & the High Line

### Morning: SoHo (9:30 AM)

Take the subway to **Spring Street** (C/E) or **Prince Street** (N/R/W). SoHo's cast-iron architecture is best appreciated in the morning light before the shopping crowds arrive.

Walk along **Greene Street** between Houston and Canal — the longest continuous row of cast-iron facades in the world. Look up. The buildings are more impressive than most of what's inside them.

SoHo is NYC's premier shopping district, but if stores aren't your thing, walk through quickly and focus on the architecture and street energy. **Housing Works Bookstore Cafe** (126 Crosby St) is a gorgeous secondhand bookshop in a former warehouse. All proceeds go to fighting homelessness and AIDS. Browse for 20 minutes and grab a coffee ($4-5).

### Late Morning: Greenwich Village (11:00 AM)

Walk west into **Greenwich Village**, the neighborhood that gave America its counterculture. Bob Dylan played these streets. The Stonewall uprising happened here. It still feels different from the rest of Manhattan.

**Key stops:**
- **Washington Square Park** — the beating heart of the Village. Street musicians, chess players, NYU students. The arch is modeled after the Arc de Triomphe. Free.
- **Bleecker Street** — walk west along Bleecker from the park. Hit **Murray's Cheese** (#254) for free samples and insane grilled cheese sandwiches ($12-15). **John's of Bleecker Street** (#278) for no-slice, whole-pie pizza in a former church with stained glass windows ($22-28 per pie).
- **Christopher Street & the Stonewall Inn** (#53 Christopher St) — a National Historic Landmark and the birthplace of the LGBTQ+ rights movement. It's still a working bar.
- **The Comedy Cellar** (117 MacDougal St): Where every major comedian has performed. Shows nightly at 7:30, 9:30, and 11:30 PM. Tickets $15-25 + 2-drink minimum ($12-18 each). Book at comedycellar.com.

**Lunch:**
- **Joe's Pizza** (7 Carmine St): The original location. $3.75 per slice. The line is always long and it always moves fast.
- **Mamoun's Falafel** (119 MacDougal St): Legendary falafel since 1971. $5.50 for a sandwich. Cash only.
- **Via Carota** (51 Grove St): Italian with a beautiful garden. Cacio e pepe $26, whole branzino $38. No reservations — arrive at 11:30 AM to avoid a 2-hour wait.

### Afternoon: Chelsea Market & the High Line (2:00 PM)

Walk north to **Chelsea Market** (75 9th Ave, between 15th and 16th streets). This former Nabisco factory is now a gourmet food hall.

**Best bets inside Chelsea Market:**
- **Los Tacos No. 1**: If you missed them on Day 1, don't miss them again. Adobada taco $5.50.
- **The Lobster Place**: Lobster roll $28, fresh oysters $3.50 each
- **Li-Lac Chocolates**: NYC's oldest chocolate house (since 1923). Try the almond bark ($8)
- **Doughnuttery**: Mini doughnuts, 6 for $5

**Time needed:** 30-60 minutes depending on how much you eat.

### The High Line (3:00 PM)

Exit Chelsea Market at the 16th Street entrance and walk up to **the High Line** — a 1.45-mile elevated park built on a disused freight rail line. It runs from Gansevoort Street (Meatpacking District) to 34th Street (Hudson Yards).

Enter at **16th Street** and walk north. The park features rotating art installations, wildflower plantings, and some of the best urban views in the world. There are multiple places to sit and just watch the city from above.

**Key spots along the High Line:**
- **10th Avenue Square** (17th St) — stadium-style seating with a window overlooking the avenue below
- **The Spur** (30th St) — the widest section with large-scale art installations
- **Interim Walkway** — a glass-bottom section over the street

The walk takes 30-45 minutes without stops, but give yourself 60-90 minutes to sit, photograph, and enjoy.

### Late Afternoon: Hudson Yards (4:30 PM)

The High Line ends at **Hudson Yards**, Manhattan's newest neighborhood. Love it or hate it architecturally, it's undeniably impressive at scale.

- **The Vessel** (temporarily closed for structural review — check hudsonyrdsnewyork.com for 2026 status before visiting)
- **Edge** (30 Hudson Yards): The highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere. $44 adult. The glass floor 1,100 feet above the street is genuinely terrifying.
- **The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards**: High-end shopping if that's your thing. The architecture of the complex is worth seeing regardless.

### Evening: Final Night in NYC

For your last dinner, go somewhere memorable:

- **Don Angie** (103 Greenwich Ave): Creative Italian. The pinwheel lasagna is famous for a reason. $40-65 per person. Reserve on Resy weeks ahead.
- **Tatiana** (Lincoln Center, 10 Lincoln Center Plaza): Award-winning restaurant with a terrace overlooking the fountain. Russian-American menu, $50-80 per person.
- **Wo Hop** (17 Mott St, Chinatown): Open until 4 AM, cash only, below street level. Old-school Chinese-American food since 1938. Chow fun $10, egg rolls $3. The perfect chaotic NYC ending.

For a final drink:
- **Please Don't Tell (PDT)** (113 St. Marks Pl): Enter through a phone booth inside a hot dog shop. Yes, really. Cocktails $18-22. Reservations required.
- **Attaboy** (134 Eldridge St): No menu — tell the bartender what you like and they'll make you something perfect. $17-20.

## FAQ

### Is 5 days enough to see New York?

Five days is ideal for a first visit. You'll cover Manhattan's major neighborhoods (Midtown, Lower Manhattan, the Village, Harlem, the Upper West Side) plus Brooklyn highlights. You won't see everything — nobody ever does — but you'll experience the city's range without feeling rushed. Return visitors can easily fill 5 more days with the outer boroughs alone.

### What is the best area to stay in New York for 5 days?

**Midtown** (30th-55th St) offers the best subway access and puts you within 20 minutes of everything on this itinerary. For more neighborhood character, try the **Lower East Side** or **East Village** — more local restaurants, better nightlife, and slightly lower hotel prices. **Williamsburg, Brooklyn** is a strong option if you want the Brooklyn experience with easy L-train access to Manhattan.

### How much money do I need for 5 days in New York?

Budget travelers can manage $200-330 per day ($1,000-1,660 total) by staying in hostels or budget hotels, eating street food and pizza, and using the subway. Mid-range visitors should budget $410-690 per day ($2,060-3,450 total). The biggest variable is accommodation — booking 2-3 months ahead can save 30-40% on hotel rates.

### Is the New York subway safe?

Yes. The NYC subway carries over 3.5 million riders daily and is overwhelmingly safe. Use common sense: stay aware of your surroundings, keep your phone secure, and avoid empty cars late at night. During rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM), the biggest danger is someone stepping on your foot.

### What is the best time of year to visit New York?

**September-November** is peak: warm days (15-25°C / 60-77°F), fall foliage in Central Park, and the city buzzing with energy. **April-June** is equally excellent with mild weather and outdoor dining season. **December** is magical (holiday markets, Rockefeller tree, window displays) but cold (0-7°C / 32-45°F) and extremely crowded. **January-February** is the cheapest time to visit — hotel prices drop 30-40% — but bundle up.
