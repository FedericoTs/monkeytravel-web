# The Perfect 5-Day Italy Itinerary: Rome, Florence & Beyond (2026)

Five days in Italy is the sweet spot for a first trip. Enough to get the big hits in Rome and Florence without sprinting through them, plus a day trip that gives you either Venice's canals or the Amalfi Coast's cliffs. Less than five days and you're rushing. More and you should add a third base city.

This itinerary is built on real train schedules, real opening hours, and real 2026 prices. Every restaurant recommendation is a place we'd actually eat at — not just the first result on Google Maps.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Between Cities

Italy's high-speed trains are the backbone of this trip. Two operators — **Trenitalia** (Frecciarossa) and **Italo** — compete on the same routes, which keeps prices reasonable.

| Route | Duration | Price Range | Book At |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Rome → Florence | 1h 30m | €19-50 | trenitalia.com or italotreno.it |
| Florence → Venice | 2h 05m | €22-55 | trenitalia.com or italotreno.it |
| Florence → Naples (for Amalfi) | 2h 45m | €19-45 | trenitalia.com or italotreno.it |

**Booking tip:** Trenitalia's "Super Economy" and Italo's "Low Cost" fares open 4 months ahead. Book 2-3 weeks out for the best prices. Walk-up fares are often double.

### Budget Breakdown (Per Person)

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Accommodation/night | €40-80 | €100-180 | €250+ |
| Food/day | €25-45 | €50-90 | €120+ |
| Transport/day | €8-15 | €15-30 | €40+ |
| Activities/day | €15-25 | €25-50 | €70+ |
| **Daily Total** | **€88-165** | **€190-350** | **€480+** |

### 5-Day Total Estimate

| Level | Accommodation | Food | Transport | Activities | **Total** |
|-------|---------------|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Budget | €200-400 | €125-225 | €80-120 | €75-125 | **€480-870** |
| Mid-Range | €500-900 | €250-450 | €120-200 | €125-250 | **€995-1,800** |

*Excludes international flights. Transport includes intercity trains and local transit.*

### When to Visit

- **Best months:** April-May and September-October. Warm weather (18-26°C), manageable crowds, shoulder-season prices.
- **Avoid:** July-August. 35°C+ heat, peak prices, and every attraction is packed. Christmas/New Year is also peak pricing.
- **Budget pick:** November or February-March. Florence in February is quiet and beautiful. Rome never really shuts down.

## Day 1: Rome — Ancient City

### Morning: Colosseum & Roman Forum (8:30 AM)

Start early. The Colosseum opens at 8:30 AM and the first hour is the calmest you'll get. Book the **Full Experience** ticket which includes the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill — it's valid for two consecutive days, so you can split the visit.

- **Full Experience ticket:** €22 (arena floor access adds €24 for the €46 total — worth it)
- **Hours:** 8:30 AM - 7:00 PM (April-September), shorter in winter
- **Time needed:** 1.5 hours for Colosseum, 1.5-2 hours for Forum + Palatine

**Important:** Online booking is mandatory in 2026. Walk-up ticket sales are extremely limited. Book at colosseo.it at least 1 week ahead, especially April-October.

Walk through the **Roman Forum** afterwards — it's included in your ticket and you're already right there. Don't skip **Palatine Hill** above the Forum: fewer crowds than the main ruins, better views, and shaded gardens for when the sun gets intense.

### Lunch: Monti Neighborhood (12:30 PM)

Walk 10 minutes north from the Forum to **Monti**, Rome's coolest neighborhood that most tourists miss entirely because they turn right toward the Trevi Fountain instead.

- **La Carbonara** (Via Panisperna 214): Historic trattoria, excellent carbonara for €12
- **Ai Tre Scalini** (Via Panisperna 251): Great wine bar with pasta around €10-13
- **Antico Forno ai Serpenti**: Pizza al taglio (by the slice) from €3

### Afternoon: Trevi Fountain, Pantheon & Piazza Navona (2:30 PM)

These three are within a 15-minute walking triangle of each other — and they're all free.

**Trevi Fountain:** Arrive after 2 PM (morning crowds thin out). The fountain underwent a thorough cleaning in 2024 and looks stunning. Toss your coin with your right hand over your left shoulder. Don't sit on the fountain edge — police fine people €250 for this.

**Pantheon:** Open daily, free entry (timed tickets required since 2023 — book at pantheon.cultura.gov.it, €5 ticket). The oculus in the dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome, 2,000 years later. Give it 20-30 minutes.

**Piazza Navona:** Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers, street artists, and some of Rome's most beautiful baroque architecture. Grab a gelato from **Frigidarium** on Via del Governo Vecchio (5 minutes away, €3-4) — one of Rome's highest-rated gelaterias.

### Evening: Trastevere (6:30 PM)

Cross the Tiber to **Trastevere**, Rome's best neighborhood for dinner. Cobblestone streets, ivy-covered buildings, and restaurants where the menu is still written on a chalkboard.

- **Da Enzo al 29** (Via dei Vascellari 29): Legendary for cacio e pepe and amatriciana. Expect a 30-45 minute wait — no reservations. Pasta €10-13.
- **Tonnarello**: Huge portions, lively atmosphere, similar prices. Reservations possible.
- **Nannarella**: Perfect for a post-dinner gelato on the piazza.

After dinner, walk along the Tiber. The view from **Ponte Sisto** at night — looking toward St. Peter's dome lit up across the water — is free and unforgettable.

---

## Day 2: Rome — Vatican & Beyond

### Morning: Vatican Museums & Sistine Chapel (8:00 AM)

Book the earliest entry slot (8:00 AM). By 10 AM, the museums hit 20,000+ visitors and the Sistine Chapel becomes a shoulder-to-shoulder shuffle.

- **Standard ticket:** €17 (book at museivaticani.va)
- **Skip-the-line with guided tour:** €30-40 (often worth it for Raphael Rooms context)
- **Hours:** 8:00 AM - 6:30 PM (last entry 4:30 PM). Closed Sundays except the last Sunday of the month (free entry, massive crowds).

**Strategy:** Speed through the first galleries (Egyptian, tapestries) and slow down for the **Raphael Rooms** and **Sistine Chapel**. Total time: 2.5-3 hours with focus.

**Pro tip:** There's a shortcut from the Sistine Chapel directly into St. Peter's Basilica — watch for the door on the right side marked for tour groups. It saves 30 minutes of walking back through the museums and around the walls.

### Late Morning: St. Peter's Basilica (11:00 AM)

St. Peter's is free to enter. The security line takes 15-30 minutes. Once inside, see Michelangelo's Pietà (first chapel on the right), Bernini's Baldachin, and look up at the dome.

For the **dome climb:** €8 with elevator halfway + stairs, or €6 all stairs (551 steps). The view from the top is the best panorama in Rome. Go early — the stairwell gets hot and crowded by noon.

### Lunch: Prati / Vatican Area (1:00 PM)

Most restaurants immediately around the Vatican are tourist traps. Walk 10 minutes into **Prati** neighborhood instead:

- **Pizzarium** (Via della Meloria 43): Gabriele Bonci's legendary pizza al taglio. €5-8 for a filling meal. Often called the best pizza in Rome.
- **Sciascia Caffè** (Via Fabio Massimo 80): Excellent espresso and light lunch.
- **Osteria dell'Ingegno**: Sit-down option near Piazza Navona, mains €14-18.

### Afternoon: Borghese Gallery or Free Rome (3:00 PM)

**Option A: Galleria Borghese** — Rome's most beautiful museum, housed in a 17th-century villa surrounded by gardens. Bernini's sculptures here (Apollo and Daphne, The Rape of Proserpina) are jaw-dropping.

- **Tickets:** €15 (2-hour timed slots, **always** sold out — book at galleriaborghese.beniculturali.it weeks in advance)
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - 7:00 PM. Closed Mondays.

**Option B: Free afternoon.** Walk through **Villa Borghese** gardens (free), toss coins at lesser-known fountains, wander the Jewish Ghetto for its incredible food scene, or revisit the Roman Forum with your still-valid combo ticket.

### Evening: Campo de' Fiori & Testaccio

Start at **Campo de' Fiori** around sunset for aperitivo at one of the square's wine bars (Spritz or Negroni for €8-10 with snacks). Then head south to **Testaccio** — Rome's original foodie neighborhood.

- **Flavio al Velavevodetto** (Via di Monte Testaccio 97): Outstanding Roman cuisine built into a hill of ancient pottery shards. Pasta €10-14.
- **Trapizzino** (Via Giovanni Branca 88): Triangular pizza pockets stuffed with traditional Roman fillings. €3.50 each — grab 2-3 for a street-food dinner.

---

## Day 3: Rome → Florence (Morning Train)

### Morning: Train to Florence (9:00 AM)

Catch a Frecciarossa or Italo train from **Roma Termini** to **Firenze Santa Maria Novella**. The 1h 30m ride is comfortable, with Wi-Fi and a coffee bar. You'll arrive by 10:30 AM.

**Tip:** Book a window seat on the left side heading north for views of the Tuscan countryside after Orvieto.

Drop your bags at the hotel (most Florence hotels are walkable from SMN station — the entire centro storico is compact) and start exploring.

### Late Morning: Duomo & Baptistery (11:00 AM)

The **Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore** (the Duomo) is free to enter, but the real experience is climbing **Brunelleschi's Dome** — 463 steps through the inner shell of the dome with frescoes inches from your face.

- **Brunelleschi's Dome:** €30 combo ticket (includes Dome, Baptistery, Bell Tower, Crypt, and Opera Museum — valid 72 hours). Book at duomo.firenze.it.
- **Hours:** Dome climb 8:15 AM - 6:45 PM. Timed entry required.
- **Time needed:** 45 minutes for the climb. Arrive at your booked slot.

The **Baptistery** is right outside — Ghiberti's "Gates of Paradise" bronze doors are one of the Renaissance's greatest works. Included in the combo.

### Lunch: San Lorenzo Market Area (1:00 PM)

Walk 5 minutes north to the **Mercato Centrale** (ground floor for fresh produce, upstairs food hall for prepared food):

- **Lampredotto sandwich** from a street cart outside the market (€4-5) — this is Florence's signature street food. Slow-cooked tripe in a bread roll. Trust us.
- **Da Nerbone** (inside Mercato Centrale, ground floor): Operating since 1872. Boiled beef sandwich (panino con bollito) for €5.
- Upstairs food hall: Various stalls with pasta, pizza, and Tuscan specialties (€8-15).

### Afternoon: Uffizi Gallery (2:30 PM)

The **Uffizi** holds the definitive collection of Renaissance art — Botticelli's Birth of Venus and Primavera, Leonardo's Annunciation, Caravaggio's Medusa. It's not optional on a Florence trip.

- **Tickets:** €25 (€4 booking fee). Timed entry mandatory — book at uffizi.it.
- **Hours:** 8:15 AM - 6:30 PM. Closed Mondays.
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours.

**Strategy:** Book a 2:30 or 3:00 PM slot. Morning is peak. Head straight to Rooms 10-14 for Botticelli, then work forward chronologically. Don't miss the Tribuna (Room 18) and the rooftop terrace with its Duomo view.

### Evening: Ponte Vecchio & Oltrarno (6:00 PM)

Walk out the Uffizi's back exit directly onto the **Piazzale degli Uffizi** with its view down to the Arno River. Turn right and you're at **Ponte Vecchio** in 2 minutes — the medieval bridge lined with gold shops, best photographed from the Ponte Santa Trinita one bridge upstream.

Cross into **Oltrarno** — Florence's Left Bank. Less touristy, more lived-in, better food.

- **Trattoria 4 Leoni** (Via dei Vellutini 1r): Famous for pear-and-pecorino ravioli. Mains €12-16. Book ahead.
- **Il Latini** (Via dei Palchetti 6r): Legendary Florentine steakhouse with communal tables. Bistecca alla Fiorentina for two: €50-60 (1kg of glorious T-bone). Loud, chaotic, worth it.
- **Gustapanino** (near Ponte Vecchio): Gourmet panini for €6-8 if you want something quick.

After dinner, walk to **Piazzale Michelangelo** (20 minutes uphill from Ponte Vecchio). The sunset view over Florence is the most famous panorama in Tuscany — and it's free. Bring a bottle of wine from an enoteca (€5-10).

---

## Day 4: Florence — Art, Artisans & Tuscan Food

### Morning: Accademia Gallery (8:30 AM)

See Michelangelo's **David** — the original, not the replica in the piazza. It's bigger and more detailed than any photograph prepares you for. The gallery is small, so 45-60 minutes is plenty.

- **Tickets:** €16 (€4 booking fee). Book at galleriaaccademiafirenze.it.
- **Hours:** 8:15 AM - 6:50 PM. Closed Mondays.

Book the first slot (8:15-8:30 AM). You'll practically have David to yourself.

### Mid-Morning: San Lorenzo & Medici Chapels (10:00 AM)

Walk 5 minutes to the **Basilica di San Lorenzo** and the attached **Medici Chapels** — Michelangelo's architecture and sculptures for the powerful family that funded the Renaissance.

- **Medici Chapels:** €9. Closed 1st and 3rd Monday of the month.
- **Time needed:** 45 minutes.

Browse the **San Lorenzo leather market** outside — but bargain hard. Starting prices are 50-100% inflated. Real leather goods start around €40-60 for a decent wallet, €150+ for bags. If it smells like plastic, it's not leather.

### Lunch: Santa Croce Area (12:30 PM)

Walk to the **Santa Croce** neighborhood:

- **All'Antico Vinaio** (Via dei Neri 65r): Florence's most famous sandwich shop. Schiacciata bread stuffed with cured meats, truffle cream, and artichokes. €5-7. The line moves fast.
- **Trattoria da Rocco** (inside Mercato di Sant'Ambrogio): Locals-only market. Full Tuscan lunch for €8-10. Closes at 2 PM — don't be late.
- **Vivoli**: Historic gelateria since 1930. Crema Vivoli flavor. €3-5.

### Afternoon: Choose Your Own Florence

**Option A: Palazzo Pitti & Boboli Gardens**

The Medici's massive palace on the Oltrarno side. The **Palatine Gallery** inside has works by Raphael, Titian, and Caravaggio in rooms that are as impressive as the art.

- **Tickets:** €16 (palace + Boboli Gardens combo). Valid 3 days.
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours.

The **Boboli Gardens** behind the palace are a perfect afternoon wander — Renaissance landscaping, hidden grottos, and views over the Tuscan hills.

**Option B: Artisan Florence**

Cross into Oltrarno and explore Florence's workshops:
- **Scuola del Cuoio** (inside Santa Croce Church): Leather school where you can watch craftspeople at work and buy directly.
- Walk Via Maggio and Via Santo Spirito for antique shops, frame makers, and bookbinders.
- Stop at **Caffè Pitti** or **Volume** for a mid-afternoon coffee on a quiet piazza.

### Evening: Santo Spirito (7:00 PM)

**Piazza Santo Spirito** is where Florentines actually hang out. Grab an Aperol Spritz (€6-8) at one of the piazza bars, then dinner:

- **Trattoria Borgo Antico** (Piazza Santo Spirito 6r): Good bistecca, great people-watching. Mains €12-16.
- **Gusta Pizza** (Via Maggio 46r): Arguably Florence's best Neapolitan-style pizza. Margherita €7. Cash only.
- **Il Santino**: Wine bar with incredible crostini and small plates. Perfect for a lighter dinner. €15-20.

---

## Day 5: Day Trip — Venice or Amalfi Coast

You have two outstanding options. Choose based on your interests:

### Option A: Venice Day Trip

Take the 7:00 or 7:30 AM Frecciarossa from **Firenze SMN** to **Venezia Santa Lucia** (2h 05m, €22-55). You'll arrive by 9:15 AM and have a full day.

**Morning (9:15 AM - 12:30 PM):**
Walk out of the station directly onto the **Grand Canal** — the most dramatic arrival of any city in the world. Turn right and walk toward **Piazza San Marco** (30-40 minutes on foot through the maze of alleys — getting slightly lost is part of the experience).

Visit **St. Mark's Basilica** (free entry, but the €3 skip-the-line reservation at basilicasanmarco.it saves 45+ minutes). The gold mosaics covering 8,000 square meters of ceiling are staggering.

The **Doge's Palace** is next door: €30 for the standard ticket. The Bridge of Sighs, the prison, and the grand council halls take about 90 minutes.

**Lunch (12:30 PM):**
Avoid everything within 50 meters of San Marco. Instead:
- **Rosticceria Gislon** (near Rialto Bridge): Cheap, fast, surprisingly good. Fried seafood and tramezzini (sandwich triangles) for €3-5 each.
- **Osteria Al Portego** (Castello 6015): Excellent cicchetti (Venetian tapas) at €1.50-3 each. Stand at the bar like a local.
- **Dai Zemei** (San Polo): Tiny cicchetti bar near Rialto. 5-6 pieces plus a glass of wine for €10-12.

**Afternoon (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM):**
Cross the **Rialto Bridge** and wander through **San Polo** and **Dorsoduro** — less touristy, more residential Venice. Visit the **Frari Basilica** (€5) to see Titian's Assumption altarpiece.

If time allows, take the **vaporetto (water bus) Line 1** down the entire Grand Canal (€9.50 single ride, or €25 for a 24-hour pass) — it's the best €9.50 tour in Europe. Do it in the late afternoon when the light turns golden on the palazzos.

**Return:** Catch the 6:00 or 7:00 PM train back to Florence (arrive by 8:15-9:15 PM).

### Option B: Amalfi Coast Day Trip

This is more ambitious but absolutely doable. Take the 6:30 or 7:00 AM Frecciarossa from **Firenze SMN** to **Napoli Centrale** (2h 45m, €19-45).

**From Naples to the coast:**
Take the **Circumvesuviana train** from Napoli Centrale to **Sorrento** (€4.80, 70 minutes) or the faster **Campania Express** (€8, 50 minutes, reservation required). From Sorrento, the **SITA bus** runs along the Amalfi Coast road (€2.50 per ride).

**Alternative:** Take a direct SITA bus from Naples to **Positano** or **Amalfi** town (€4-6, runs seasonally).

**The Coast (11:00 AM - 5:00 PM):**
- **Positano:** The postcard village. Walk down to the beach, eat limoncello cake, take photos. Expensive for food — a basic lunch runs €15-25.
- **Amalfi town:** The main town on the coast. Visit the cathedral (€3), wander the alleys, grab granita al limone (€3-4).
- **Ravello:** Mountaintop village above Amalfi. Villa Rufolo gardens (€10) have the most famous view on the coast. Bus from Amalfi (€1.30, 25 minutes).

**Budget strategy:** Pack a picnic from a Naples deli before heading to the coast. Waterfront restaurants in Positano can charge €18+ for a basic pasta.

**Return:** Reverse the route. Aim to catch a 5:30-6:00 PM Circumvesuviana from Sorrento, then a 7:30-8:00 PM Frecciarossa from Naples to Florence (arrive ~10:30 PM).

**Honest assessment:** The Amalfi day trip is long. If you prefer a relaxed day, choose Venice. If dramatic coastal scenery is your priority and you don't mind a 14+ hour day, go Amalfi.

## How Much Does 5 Days in Italy Cost?

Here's a realistic per-person budget:

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Accommodation (5 nights) | €200-400 | €500-900 |
| Food (5 days) | €125-225 | €250-450 |
| Intercity trains | €60-100 | €80-150 |
| Local transport | €20-40 | €40-60 |
| Activities & museums | €75-125 | €125-250 |
| Day trip costs | €30-60 | €60-120 |
| **Total** | **€510-950** | **€1,055-1,930** |

**Money-saving tips:**
- Book train tickets 2-3 weeks ahead for "Super Economy" fares — often 50-60% cheaper than walk-up
- Eat your biggest meal at lunch when restaurants offer *pranzo* (set lunch) menus at half the dinner price
- Carry a water bottle — Rome's **nasoni** (public drinking fountains) and Florence's fountains dispense perfectly clean water for free
- The first Sunday of each month, Italian state museums are **free** (Colosseum, Uffizi, Borghese, and many others)
- Get a **Revolut** or **Wise** card to avoid the 2-3% foreign transaction fees most banks charge

## FAQ

### Is 5 days enough for Italy?

Five days covers Rome and Florence thoroughly, plus a day trip. It's ideal for a first visit. If you want to add Naples, the Amalfi Coast, or Cinque Terre as proper stays (not day trips), plan for 7-10 days instead. Most first-timers find 5 days satisfying if they focus on two cities.

### What is the best route for 5 days in Italy?

Rome (2 days) → Florence (2 days) → day trip (1 day) is the most efficient route. Rome and Florence are connected by a direct 1.5-hour high-speed train, and both cities serve as hubs for day trips. Starting in Rome gives you the longest possible time before your departure from either city.

### How much does the Rome to Florence train cost?

Trenitalia Frecciarossa and Italo trains run the Rome-Florence route in 1h 30m. Prices range from €19 (Super Economy, booked weeks ahead) to €50+ (Flex/walk-up). The sweet spot is €25-35 when booked 2-3 weeks in advance. Trains depart roughly every 15-30 minutes all day.

### Do I need to book museums in advance in Italy?

Yes, especially in 2026. The Colosseum, Vatican Museums, Uffizi, and Accademia Gallery all require timed-entry reservations. Walk-up tickets sell out daily during peak season. Book at least 1-2 weeks ahead. The Borghese Gallery can sell out a month ahead for popular time slots.

### Venice or Amalfi Coast for a day trip from Florence?

Venice is easier: a direct 2-hour train each way with a compact, walkable city. The Amalfi Coast is more dramatic but involves 3+ hours of transit each way plus buses. Choose Venice if you want a relaxed pace with art and canals. Choose Amalfi if you prioritize stunning coastal scenery and don't mind a long day.
