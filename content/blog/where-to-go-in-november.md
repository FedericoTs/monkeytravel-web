# Where to Go in November 2026: 12 Best Destinations Before the Holiday Rush

November is the travel calendar's best-kept secret. The summer crowds are a memory. The December holiday surge hasn't started. Flights drop roughly 30% compared to peak season. Hotels across Europe, Asia, and North Africa slash rates because they'd rather fill rooms at a discount than stare at empty ones. And the weather? It's the beginning of dry season in Southeast Asia, autumn perfection in the Mediterranean, spring in the Southern Hemisphere, and still warm enough across North Africa and the Middle East to explore outdoors all day.

The catch is that November requires precision. Some destinations are hitting their absolute sweet spot while others are sliding into their rainy or cold seasons. A week in the wrong place means gray skies and regret. A week in the right place means shoulder-season prices, thin crowds, and weather that cooperates.

We evaluated 12 destinations across four categories and scored each on the metrics that actually matter: weather reliability, realistic daily budgets, crowd levels, and what makes November specifically the month to go. Not "autumn generally." Not "before the holidays." November.

## How We Evaluated

- **Weather reliability** — Average temperatures and precipitation specifically for November. We prioritize destinations where November is a clear climatic sweet spot, not just "acceptable."
- **Daily budget** — Per-person costs covering mid-range accommodation, meals, local transport, and one activity per day. Flights excluded since they vary by origin.
- **Crowd level** — Rated 1 (quiet), 2 (busy but manageable), or 3 (peak season crowds). Based on seasonal tourism data.
- **November factor** — What makes this month specifically better than neighboring months to visit.

## Fall Foliage & Shoulder Season Cities

November's real power move in Europe and East Asia: the summer tourists left, the Christmas crowds haven't arrived, and autumn colors are at their peak in several world-class cities.

### 1. Tokyo, Japan

**Why November:** [Tokyo](/destinations/tokyo) in November is peak autumn foliage season — and the Japanese take koyo (autumn leaf viewing) as seriously as cherry blossoms. The city's parks and gardens explode in crimson, gold, and amber while temperatures hover in the comfortable mid-teens. Unlike the spring sakura madness, November crowds are manageable, and the weather is reliably dry with crisp blue skies. This is Tokyo at its most photogenic without the chaos.

**Avg temp:** 10-18°C (50-64°F)
**Daily budget:** $100-180/person
**Crowd level:** 2
**Best for:** Nature lovers, photographers, food lovers, culture seekers

Rikugien Gardens and Koishikawa Korakuen are the headliners for autumn color — both offer evening illumination events in mid-to-late November that transform the foliage into something otherworldly. Meiji Jingu Gaien's ginkgo avenue turns a uniform, blazing yellow that draws photographers from around the world. Entry to most parks costs $3-5 or is free.

The food scene peaks alongside the foliage. November is matsutake mushroom season, seasonal ramen specials appear everywhere, and convenience stores start stocking nikuman (steamed meat buns) — the perfect $1.50 walking snack. A proper kaiseki dinner showcasing autumn ingredients runs $60-120 at mid-range restaurants, or $15-25 at more casual establishments. Our [Tokyo 4-day itinerary](/blog/tokyo-4-day-itinerary) covers the core logistics, but November adds an entire seasonal layer.

**Insider tip:** The Japan Rail Pass (7-day from $200) lets you day-trip to Nikko (2 hours north), where the autumn color is even more spectacular than Tokyo, framing ancient shrines and waterfalls. Go on a weekday to avoid domestic tourist crowds.

---

### 2. Lisbon, Portugal

**Why November:** [Lisbon](/destinations/lisbon) in November is Europe's best shoulder-season value. Summer's intense heat and crowds have gone, temperatures remain mild enough for full days of walking, and hotel prices drop 30-50% from peak. The city's seven hills, azulejo-tiled facades, and golden light don't disappear in autumn — they just come with a smaller audience. This is the Lisbon the locals actually enjoy.

**Avg temp:** 11-18°C (52-64°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-140/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** Budget travelers, food lovers, architecture enthusiasts, digital nomads

November rain is the elephant in the room. Yes, Lisbon gets more rain in November than summer. But "more rain" means roughly 6-8 rainy days across the month, and showers tend to be intermittent rather than all-day washouts. Between the rain, you get soft autumn light that makes the city's tile work glow. Pack a compact umbrella and you'll be fine.

The value is extraordinary. Mid-range boutique hotels in Alfama or Bairro Alto that charge $180-250/night in July drop to $80-120 in November. A pastel de nata at the famous Pasteis de Belem: $1.30. A full seafood lunch at a local tasca: $12-18. A bottle of excellent Portuguese wine: $5-8 at a shop, $12-20 at a restaurant. The tram 28 experience, which is a sardine-can nightmare in summer, becomes genuinely enjoyable. Check our [Lisbon 3-day itinerary](/blog/lisbon-3-day-itinerary) for a day-by-day plan.

**Insider tip:** The Feira da Ladra flea market (Tuesdays and Saturdays) is where Lisbon locals have hunted for antiques and oddities since the 12th century. November means smaller crowds and better bargaining leverage. Arrive before 10 AM for the best picks.

---

### 3. Istanbul, Turkey

**Why November:** [Istanbul](/destinations/istanbul) is one of the most underrated November destinations in the world. The suffocating summer heat is gone, replaced by cool, crisp days perfect for walking between the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, and Topkapi Palace without breaking a sweat. Tourist numbers drop dramatically — you can actually photograph the interiors of major monuments without fifty strangers in your shot. And the prices reflect the low season across the board.

**Avg temp:** 8-15°C (46-59°F)
**Daily budget:** $50-110/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** History buffs, food lovers, budget travelers, couples

November Istanbul is a food city operating at full power. The cool weather means hearty Turkish cuisine at its best — slow-cooked lamb stews, fresh simit from street vendors ($0.50), and balik ekmek (fish sandwiches) at the Galata Bridge for $3-4. A full kebab dinner at a mid-range restaurant runs $10-15 per person. The Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar are still open and vibrant but without the summer elbow-to-elbow experience.

Accommodation drops significantly. Boutique hotels in Sultanahmet that charge $150-250/night in summer are available for $60-100 in November. A hamam (Turkish bath) experience at a historic bathhouse like Cemberlitas costs $30-50 — an experience worth every penny on a cool November evening. Our [Istanbul 3-day itinerary](/blog/istanbul-3-day-itinerary) covers the must-see route.

**Insider tip:** Take the Bosphorus ferry (only $1.50 for the public commuter ferry, not the $15-25 tourist boat) from Eminonu to Kadikoy on the Asian side. The November light over the water is spectacular, and Kadikoy's food market is vastly more authentic and cheaper than the European side tourist spots.

## Dry Season Tropics & Warm Escapes

November marks the start of dry season across much of Southeast Asia and remains comfortably warm in North Africa and the Middle East. These destinations deliver reliable sunshine and warmth while the Northern Hemisphere cools down.

### 4. Bangkok, Thailand

**Why November:** [Bangkok](/destinations/bangkok) in November signals the arrival of the cool, dry season — the monsoon rains taper off, humidity drops to bearable levels, and the city enters its most pleasant weather window. The famous Loi Krathong festival (floating lantern ceremony) typically falls in November, turning the Chao Phraya River and canals into rivers of candlelight. It's the gateway to Thailand's high season but prices haven't fully climbed yet — a narrow window of good weather and pre-peak value.

**Avg temp:** 23-32°C (73-90°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-110/person
**Crowd level:** 2
**Best for:** Food lovers, budget travelers, culture seekers, nightlife enthusiasts

Bangkok's legendary street food scene thrives in November's cooler evenings. Pad Thai from a Michelin-recognized street vendor: $1.50-2. A full bowl of boat noodles in Victory Monument: $0.80. Green curry at a local restaurant: $3-5. For upscale dining, a tasting menu at a Bangkok Michelin-starred restaurant runs $30-50 — a fraction of comparable experiences in any Western city.

Loi Krathong is the standout November event. Held on the full moon of the 12th lunar month (usually mid-November), the festival involves releasing small decorated boats with candles and flowers onto the water. The celebrations along the Chao Phraya and at Asiatique Night Market are unforgettable. Our [Bangkok 5-day itinerary](/blog/bangkok-5-day-itinerary) covers the food-and-temple circuit that works perfectly in November's comfortable temperatures.

**Insider tip:** The BTS Skytrain and MRT combined cover nearly every major tourist area for $0.50-1.50 per ride. Skip the tuk-tuks for anything more than novelty — they charge tourists 5-10x what the distance is worth. The Chatuchak Weekend Market is genuinely enjoyable in November weather, unlike the brutal heat of March-May.

---

### 5. Bali, Indonesia

**Why November:** [Bali](/destinations/bali) in November occupies an interesting position. It's technically the transition into wet season, but early November often behaves more like the tail end of dry season — warm, mostly sunny mornings with brief afternoon showers that clear quickly. The key advantage: prices are at their lowest. The Australian school holiday crowds haven't arrived, European winter travelers haven't booked yet, and the island offers its famously cheap luxury at even deeper discounts.

**Avg temp:** 24-30°C (75-86°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-90/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** Budget luxury seekers, surfers, digital nomads, couples

The value proposition in November Bali borders on absurd. A private villa with a pool in Canggu or Ubud: $35-60/night (versus $70-120 in peak season). A two-hour Balinese massage: $12-18. A full meal at a local warung: $2-4. Even upscale restaurants in Seminyak run $15-25 per person with cocktails. If you're coming from anywhere in the Western world, your daily spending power effectively doubles.

November rain reality: expect 1-2 hours of rain most afternoons, usually between 2-5 PM. Mornings are typically clear and sunny — plan outdoor activities, temple visits, and beach time before noon. The rice terraces in Tegallalang are lush green from recent rains, and the surf breaks at Uluwatu and Padang Padang are firing with the early-season swell. Our [Bali 7-day itinerary](/blog/bali-7-day-itinerary) is adaptable to November's rain pattern with morning-focused scheduling.

**Insider tip:** Munduk in northern Bali is the November sweet spot. Fewer tourists, cooler mountain temperatures (22-26°C), stunning waterfalls, and accommodation for $20-40/night. The coffee plantations here offer tours and tastings for $5-10 — including some of the best Balinese coffee you'll ever drink.

---

### 6. Marrakech, Morocco

**Why November:** [Marrakech](/destinations/marrakech) in November is a shoulder-season masterpiece. The crushing summer heat (40°C+) has broken, leaving daytime temperatures in the comfortable low-to-mid 20s — perfect for wandering the souks, exploring the Medina, and sitting in courtyard gardens. Tourist numbers are low, which means better prices on everything from riad stays to guided tours, and the locals have more time and energy for genuine interactions. The Atlas Mountains in the background are often dusted with early snow, creating a striking visual contrast.

**Avg temp:** 10-24°C (50-75°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-100/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** Culture seekers, bargain hunters, photographers, food lovers

Marrakech's November pricing is some of the best in the Mediterranean region. A beautiful riad in the Medina with breakfast included: $40-70/night (versus $100-180 in spring). A traditional hammam session: $10-20. A full three-course Moroccan dinner (tagine, couscous, pastilla) at a quality restaurant: $10-18 per person. The Jemaa el-Fnaa food stalls run nightly, and November's cool evenings make the experience far more enjoyable than summer's oppressive heat.

Day trips from Marrakech are at their best in November. The Ouzoud Waterfalls (2.5 hours) are flowing well from autumn rains. The Atlas Mountains offer excellent trekking conditions — daytime temperatures around 15°C at altitude, clear skies, and far fewer hikers than spring. Even a Sahara Desert excursion (2-day from $80-150 per person) is comfortable in November, with warm days and cool desert nights perfect for stargazing.

**Insider tip:** Negotiate everything in the souks, but do so with a smile. November vendors see fewer tourists and may be more willing to give genuine discounts — aim for 40-50% off the initial asking price as a starting point. For spices, the Rahba Kedima square has better prices than the main tourist-facing stalls.

## Cultural & Adventure Destinations

November is the goldilocks month for destinations that are too hot in summer and too cold in deep winter. These places reward travelers who time it right.

### 7. Oaxaca, Mexico

**Why November:** Oaxaca in November rides the afterglow of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead, November 1-2) and settles into one of its most pleasant weather months. The rainy season has ended, temperatures are warm during the day and refreshingly cool at night, and the cultural calendar is packed. Oaxacan food — widely considered Mexico's best regional cuisine — reaches its peak form with fresh mole season and mezcal harvest.

**Avg temp:** 11-27°C (52-81°F)
**Daily budget:** $50-100/person
**Crowd level:** 2 (early November around Day of the Dead), 1 (rest of month)
**Best for:** Foodies, culture seekers, mezcal enthusiasts, photographers

If you can time your arrival for November 1-2, the Day of the Dead celebrations in Oaxaca are among the most authentic in Mexico. Cemeteries are decorated with marigolds and candles, families gather for overnight vigils, and the streets fill with parades, face-painting, and live music. It's deeply moving rather than commercially tourist-oriented. After the festivities, the city returns to a relaxed pace with excellent weather.

Oaxacan food deserves the hype. A tlayuda (Oaxacan pizza) from a market stall: $2-3. Mole negro at a traditional restaurant: $6-10. A mezcal tasting at a small-batch distillery: $5-15. The Mercado de Abastos is one of Mexico's largest indigenous markets and a labyrinth of food, crafts, and culture. November prices for boutique hotels in the centro historico run $50-80/night — remarkable for a destination of this caliber.

**Insider tip:** Book a mezcal distillery tour in the surrounding villages (Matatan, Santiago Matatlan). November is just after the harvest, so you can see the production process in full swing. A half-day tour with transport and tastings costs $25-40 per person and includes some of the best mezcal you'll ever try — stuff that never leaves the region.

---

### 8. Jordan (Petra & Amman)

**Why November:** November is Jordan's sweet spot. Summer temperatures that made Petra nearly unbearable (40°C+) have dropped to a comfortable 20-22°C during the day, making the long walks through the Siq and around the ancient city genuinely enjoyable. Wadi Rum's desert landscape is ideal for camping under the stars — warm enough during the day, cool at night (10-15°C), with crystal-clear skies. November falls between the hot summer crowds and the cold winter rains, hitting a narrow window of perfect exploration weather.

**Avg temp:** 10-22°C (50-72°F)
**Daily budget:** $70-150/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** History buffs, adventure seekers, photographers, couples

Petra alone justifies the trip. The two-day Petra pass ($70) is the best value — day one for the main Siq-to-Treasury route plus the Monastery, day two for the less-visited trails like the High Place of Sacrifice and the Royal Tombs. In November, the afternoon light on the Treasury facade turns it a deep rose-gold color that photographs can't fully capture. Petra by Night (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday — $22) lights the Siq and Treasury with 1,500 candles.

Wadi Rum is the second must-do. A one-night Bedouin camp experience with dinner, a 4x4 desert tour, and sleeping under the stars costs $60-100 per person. November's clear desert skies offer some of the best stargazing in the Middle East — the Milky Way is visible to the naked eye. For a broader Jordan itinerary, combine with the Dead Sea (90 minutes from Amman) and the Roman ruins at Jerash.

**Insider tip:** The Jordan Pass ($99-108) includes visa fees, Petra entry, and admission to 40+ sites across the country. For a 3+ day visit that includes Petra, it saves $70-80 compared to buying everything separately. Purchase it online before arriving — it replaces the visa-on-arrival fee.

---

### 9. Rajasthan, India

**Why November:** November is Rajasthan's golden month. The monsoon has passed, the desert heat has broken, and temperatures sit in a comfortable range that makes exploring the massive forts, palaces, and cities genuinely pleasant. The Pushkar Camel Fair — one of the world's most extraordinary cultural events — takes place in November, drawing thousands of camels, traders, and pilgrims to a small desert town. Diwali (festival of lights) also falls in late October or November, and Rajasthan celebrates it with particular intensity.

**Avg temp:** 14-30°C (57-86°F)
**Daily budget:** $30-80/person
**Crowd level:** 2
**Best for:** Culture seekers, budget travelers, festival enthusiasts, photographers

The Pushkar Camel Fair is unlike anything else in travel. For five days, the small town of Pushkar fills with over 50,000 camels, horses, and cattle for trading, alongside music, dance competitions, and the famous camel beauty contest. Accommodation in Pushkar during the fair is limited — book 2-3 months ahead, or stay in nearby Ajmer (30 minutes) where options are plentiful and cheaper.

Beyond Pushkar, Rajasthan's classic circuit — Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer — is at its best in November. The Amber Fort in Jaipur ($7 entry), the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur ($10 entry), and the lake palaces of Udaipur are all comfortable to explore without the summer heat that makes them exhausting. Heritage hotels (converted palaces and havelis) offer remarkable value: $30-60/night for properties that would be $200+ in any European context.

**Insider tip:** Take the overnight train between Jaipur and Jaisalmer (sleeper class $8-12, AC class $15-25). The Jaisalmer fort — a living fort with residents, restaurants, and guesthouses inside the walls — is one of India's most magical places, and November sunsets over the Thar Desert from the ramparts are extraordinary.

---

## Southern Hemisphere Spring

While the Northern Hemisphere settles into autumn, the Southern Hemisphere is blooming into spring. These destinations offer warming temperatures, long days, and the energy of a new season.

### 10. Cape Town, South Africa

**Why November:** Cape Town in November is spring at its finest — wildflowers are blooming, temperatures are warming into the low-to-mid 20s, and the summer tourist surge hasn't started yet. Table Mountain's iconic flat top is visible more often than in winter (when clouds frequently obscure it), and the long daylight hours (sunrise 5:30 AM, sunset 7:30 PM) mean maximum exploration time. The Cape Winelands are in pre-harvest mode with tasting rooms uncrowded and welcoming.

**Avg temp:** 15-24°C (59-75°F)
**Daily budget:** $60-160/person
**Crowd level:** 1-2
**Best for:** Wine lovers, nature enthusiasts, hikers, foodies

Cape Town's November pricing sits in the sweet spot before December's peak-season spike. Boutique guesthouses in the City Bowl or Sea Point that charge $150-250/night in December are $80-130 in November. A wine tasting in Stellenbosch or Franschhoek: $5-10 for 5-6 premium wines. A meal at a top Franschhoek restaurant: $20-35 per person. Table Mountain cable car: about $18 return — and November's clearer skies make the panoramic views more reliable.

The West Coast wildflower season (Namaqualand) typically ends in October, but the Cape Floral Kingdom around Cape Town stays in bloom through November. Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden ($8 entry) is spectacular, and the Constantia wine valley — the oldest wine-producing region in South Africa — is a 20-minute drive from the city center.

**Insider tip:** The Cape Peninsula day trip (Chapman's Peak, Cape Point, Boulders Beach penguins, Simon's Town) is best done in November before the summer crowds descend. Rent a car ($25-40/day) rather than taking a tour — you'll have flexibility to stop at the dozens of viewpoints along the route, and November's spring light makes every turnout a photo opportunity.

---

### 11. Patagonia, Argentina & Chile

**Why November:** November is Patagonia's spring awakening. The glaciers and peaks of Torres del Paine and Los Glaciares National Park are shaking off winter snow, wildflowers are carpeting the steppe, and the fierce Patagonian winds haven't yet reached their December-January peak intensity. Hiking trails that were closed or snow-covered in winter are reopening, and accommodation and permits are easier to secure than in the packed December-February high season.

**Avg temp:** 5-15°C (41-59°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-180/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** Hikers, nature photographers, adventure seekers, wildlife watchers

Torres del Paine's W Trek — one of the world's great multi-day hikes — opens fully in November. The refugios (mountain huts) still have availability for November dates when they're often fully booked for January. A 5-day W Trek including refugio accommodation and meals costs $800-1,200 per person, versus $1,200-1,800 in peak season. Day hikes to the base of the towers or to Grey Glacier don't require advance booking and are equally spectacular.

On the Argentine side, Perito Moreno Glacier near El Calafate is accessible year-round, but November offers the advantage of longer days, warmer temperatures for the boat approaches, and thinner crowds at the viewing platforms. The glacier's periodic calving (massive chunks breaking off into the lake) happens year-round and is one of nature's most dramatic spectacles. Entry: about $25.

**Insider tip:** Book Torres del Paine refugios and campsites 3-4 months ahead even for November — they fill up earlier each year. The lesser-known Cerro Castillo trek in Chile's Aysen region offers Torres del Paine-caliber scenery with a fraction of the hikers and no permit system. November is ideal for both.

---

### 12. Sri Lanka

**Why November:** Sri Lanka in November enters its inter-monsoon transition, and the east and north coasts begin their dry season with warm temperatures, calm seas, and uncrowded beaches. The west coast may see some rain, but the island's compact size means you can easily shift coastlines in 3-4 hours. November is also one of Sri Lanka's cheapest months, with accommodation and tour prices at their lowest before the December-March high season kicks in.

**Avg temp:** 25-30°C (77-86°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-90/person
**Crowd level:** 1
**Best for:** Beach lovers, budget travelers, wildlife enthusiasts, surfers

The east coast — Trincomalee, Arugam Bay, Passikudah — is the November sweet spot. Arugam Bay's surf breaks are still pumping with late-season swell, Trincomalee's Nilaveli Beach has turquoise water and almost no one on it, and Passikudah's shallow bay is ideal for swimming and snorkeling. A beachfront guesthouse runs $20-40/night, and a full rice-and-curry lunch at a local restaurant costs $2-4.

The Cultural Triangle (Sigiriya, Dambulla, Polonnaruwa) in Sri Lanka's interior is accessible year-round and November offers comfortable exploration temperatures. Sigiriya Rock Fortress ($30 entry for foreigners) is best climbed early morning, and November's softer light makes the ancient frescoes and the panoramic view from the summit particularly memorable. A private driver for the day (covering 100-150km) costs $30-50 — an efficient way to connect multiple ancient sites.

**Insider tip:** November is whale-watching season off Trincomalee's coast. Blue whales and sperm whales migrate through these waters, and boat trips ($40-60 per person) offer genuinely high success rates. Book with a responsible operator that maintains safe distances from the animals — Trincomalee's whale-watching industry is newer and less commercialized than Mirissa's on the south coast.

## How to Pick the Right November Destination

Still deciding? Use these filters:

**If budget is the priority:** Rajasthan ($30-80/day), Bangkok ($40-110/day), and Bali ($40-90/day) deliver the most for the least. Sri Lanka is a close fourth.

**If weather matters most:** Bangkok and Marrakech offer the most reliable sunshine. Jordan is a close third with its dry, clear November skies.

**If it's your first big autumn trip:** Tokyo's foliage season is a bucket-list experience. Istanbul offers the easiest entry into a completely different culture at bargain prices.

**If you want something different:** The Pushkar Camel Fair in Rajasthan is unlike anything else in global travel. Patagonia's spring hiking season is for those who want dramatic landscapes without the crowds.

**If you want AI-powered precision:** [MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner](https://monkeytravel.app) can generate a full November itinerary for any of these destinations in minutes — including daily schedules, restaurant picks, and budget estimates tailored to your travel style. Drop in a destination and a date range, and let the AI handle the logistics while you focus on the experience.

## November Travel Tips

### 1. Book Flights Early — But Watch for Black Friday

November airfare follows a split pattern. For early-to-mid November travel, book 2-3 months ahead for the best rates. But if you're flexible on dates, hold out for Black Friday and Cyber Monday flight sales (late November) — airlines regularly offer 20-30% off international flights for travel in January through March. Use these deals to book your next trip while you're enjoying this one.

### 2. Avoid Thanksgiving Week for Domestic US Flights

If you're flying within or from the US, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is the most expensive and chaotic flying day of the year. The Sunday after is a close second. If your November trip overlaps, fly on Thanksgiving Day itself or the Monday/Tuesday after for dramatically lower prices and calmer airports.

### 3. Layer Your Packing

November destinations span from 5°C to 32°C on this list. Even warm destinations like Bangkok and Bali have air-conditioned interiors that run cold, and evening temperatures in Marrakech and Istanbul can surprise you. A packable down jacket works in Patagonia, Tokyo, and Jordan; a light rain layer covers Bali and Lisbon.

### 4. Leverage Shoulder Season Negotiation

In destinations like Marrakech, Bali, and Istanbul, November's low season means flexibility on pricing. Hotels often have unpublished rates for direct bookings. Guesthouses and riads with availability are more likely to upgrade you or add breakfast. Don't be afraid to email directly and ask for their best November rate — it's almost always lower than what's listed on booking platforms.

### 5. Travel Insurance Is Worth It

November weather can be unpredictable — early winter storms in Europe, occasional tropical rain in Southeast Asia, and the general unpredictability of shoulder season. A comprehensive policy covering trip interruption and flight delays typically costs 5-8% of your trip total and is worth the peace of mind.

## FAQ

### What is the cheapest destination to visit in November?

Rajasthan, India offers the lowest daily costs on this list, with budget travelers spending $30-40/day for accommodation, meals, transport, and site entries. Bangkok and Bali are close seconds at $40-50/day for budget travelers. All three destinations offer rich cultural experiences and excellent food at prices that would be impossible in Western countries. Use [MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner](https://monkeytravel.app) to build a detailed budget breakdown for any of these destinations.

### Where is the warmest place to go in November?

Bangkok (23-32°C / 73-90°F), Sri Lanka (25-30°C / 77-86°F), and Bali (24-30°C / 75-86°F) are the warmest options. Rajasthan's daytime temperatures also reach 30°C, though mornings and evenings are cooler. For pure beach warmth with dry weather, Bangkok and Sri Lanka's east coast combine the highest temperatures with the least rainfall.

### Is November a good time to visit Europe?

Absolutely — but for specific reasons. Lisbon and Istanbul offer mild temperatures, thin crowds, and dramatically lower prices than summer. It's not beach weather, but it's ideal for walking-intensive city exploration, museum visits, and food-focused travel. Flights from North America to European cities drop roughly 30% from summer peaks, and accommodation is at some of its lowest annual rates.

### When is the best time to book November travel?

For flights, 8-12 weeks ahead (August-September) typically offers the best prices. For accommodation, 1-2 months ahead is sufficient for most November destinations, since it's shoulder or low season in many places. The exceptions are Patagonia (book refugios 3-4 months ahead), the Pushkar Camel Fair in Rajasthan (book 2-3 months ahead), and any Bali accommodation for the specific Nyepi dates if they fall in your window.

### Can I find good November flight deals around Thanksgiving?

Yes, with strategy. The best Black Friday and Cyber Monday flight sales (typically November 27-30) offer 20-30% off international flights for future travel dates, usually January through June. Airlines like Qatar Airways, JetBlue, and Spirit historically run aggressive promotions. For Thanksgiving week itself, flying on the holiday or the Monday/Tuesday after offers the cheapest domestic fares.
