# Passport Power Index 2026: Complete Ranking & What It Means for Your Travel

Not all passports are created equal. The document sitting in your drawer or travel bag determines not just where you can fly, but how easily you can get there — whether you breeze through an e-gate, pick up a visa on arrival, or spend weeks navigating a consulate application before you even book a hotel.

The 2026 Passport Power Index, based primarily on the Henley Passport Index (compiled from International Air Transport Association data), reveals a world where the gap between the most and least mobile citizens has never been wider. A Singaporean passport holder can visit 195 destinations without a prior visa. An Afghan passport holder can visit just 27. That 168-destination gap is the largest in the index's 20-year history.

This guide breaks down the full 2026 rankings, analyzes what drives passport power, and — most importantly — explains what it means for planning your next trip.

---

## What Is the Passport Power Index?

The Passport Power Index ranks the world's passports by the number of destinations their holders can access without obtaining a visa in advance. The two leading indexes are:

- **Henley Passport Index** (by Henley & Partners): Uses IATA data covering 227 destinations. Counts visa-free and visa-on-arrival access. Updated quarterly, it is the most widely cited ranking.
- **Arton Capital Passport Index**: Uses a similar methodology but includes additional categories like electronic travel authorizations (ETAs) and e-Visas, which can produce slightly different scores.

Both paint the same broad picture: passports from stable democracies with strong economies and active diplomatic networks rank highest, while those from conflict-affected or diplomatically isolated countries rank lowest.

**Why it matters for travelers:** Your passport's rank directly determines your planning burden. A high-ranking passport means you can book a flight and go. A lower-ranking one means you need to budget extra time and money for visa applications, potentially limiting spontaneous travel.

## Top 10 Most Powerful Passports in 2026

Here are the 2026 Henley Passport Index top-ranked passports, along with the number of destinations their holders can access visa-free or with visa-on-arrival:

| Rank | Country/Countries | Visa-Free Destinations |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Singapore** | 195 |
| 2 | **Japan, South Korea** | 188 |
| 3 | **Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland** | 186 |
| 4 | **Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway** | 185 |
| 5 | **Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, United Arab Emirates** | 184 |
| 6 | **Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, Poland** | 183 |
| 7 | **Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, United Kingdom** | 182 |
| 8 | **Canada, Iceland, Lithuania** | 181 |
| 9 | **Malaysia** | 180 |
| 10 | **United States** | 179 |

### Key Takeaways From the Top 10

**Singapore continues its reign.** For the third consecutive year, Singapore's passport is the world's most powerful. Its 195-destination score means Singaporeans can visit roughly 86% of the world without a prior visa — a staggering level of freedom.

**Asia dominates the top two spots.** Singapore, Japan, and South Korea occupying the first two ranks reinforces Asia's position at the summit of global mobility. Japan and South Korea have been consistent top performers for over a decade, benefiting from expansive bilateral agreements.

**Europe fills the middle ranks.** A remarkable 30 European countries appear in the top 10 ranks. EU membership, the Schengen Zone, and decades of reciprocal agreements give European citizens extraordinarily broad access.

**The UAE's historic rise.** The most dramatic story in passport power history belongs to the UAE. Ranked 62nd in 2006, the UAE now sits at 5th with 184 destinations — an addition of 149 visa-free destinations in 20 years. This transformation was driven by strategic diplomatic engagement, reciprocal visa-waiver agreements with the EU, Russia, China, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, and dozens more.

**The U.S. returns to the Top 10.** After briefly dropping out of the top 10 for the first time in late 2025, the United States clawed back to 10th place with 179 destinations. However, this masks a long-term decline: the U.S. jointly held 1st place with the UK in 2014.

## 10 Weakest Passports in 2026

At the other end of the spectrum, passport holders from these countries face significant barriers to international travel:

| Rank (Bottom) | Country | Visa-Free Destinations |
|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| 1 (Last) | **Afghanistan** | 27 |
| 2 | **Syria** | 29 |
| 3 | **Iraq** | 31 |
| 4 | **Pakistan** | 34 |
| 5 | **Yemen** | 35 |
| 6 | **Somalia** | 36 |
| 7 | **Palestinian Territory** | 40 |
| 8 | **Libya** | 40 |
| 9 | **North Korea** | 42 |
| 10 | **Sudan** | 46 |

### What Puts Passports at the Bottom?

The factors are consistent across the bottom 10:

- **Ongoing conflict or instability** — Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Somalia have all experienced prolonged wars or insurgencies.
- **Diplomatic isolation** — North Korea and, to varying degrees, Syria and Libya maintain limited foreign relations.
- **Weak institutional capacity** — The ability to negotiate reciprocal visa agreements requires functioning foreign ministries and stable governance.
- **Security concerns** — Countries perceived as posing higher security risks face stricter visa requirements imposed by destination countries.

The 168-destination gap between Singapore (195) and Afghanistan (27) is the widest in the index's history. In 2006, the gap between the then-top-ranking U.S. passport and Afghanistan was 118 destinations. The divide has grown by 50 destinations in two decades.

## Regional Passport Power Analysis

### Europe

Europe dominates the 2026 index like no other region. Thirty European countries appear in the top 10 ranks, and EU citizens benefit from free movement within the bloc plus extensive visa agreements worldwide.

- **Strongest:** Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland (186 destinations, rank 3)
- **Notable climbers:** Albania jumped 36 places over 20 years to rank 43rd. Ukraine climbed 34 places to 30th, and Serbia gained 30 places to 34th — all reflecting EU association agreements and diplomatic progress.
- **Western decline:** The UK (182, rank 7) and the U.S. (179, rank 10) have both recorded their steepest annual losses in visa-free access in 2026, shedding seven and eight destinations respectively.

### Asia-Pacific

Asia claims the top spot and two of the top three positions.

- **Strongest:** Singapore (195, rank 1), Japan and South Korea (188, rank 2)
- **Strong mid-tier:** Malaysia (180, rank 9), New Zealand (183, rank 6), Australia (182, rank 7)
- **Notable:** India climbed to 75th on the Henley Index in 2026, with access to 56 visa-free destinations — up from lower positions in previous years, though still with a slight drop in total access compared to 2025.

### Americas

The Americas present a split picture between strong North American passports and more variable Latin American ones.

- **Strongest in the Americas:** Canada (181, rank 8), United States (179, rank 10)
- **Strongest in Latin America:** Chile (175, rank 13 globally) — the only Latin American country in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program
- **Strong Latin American performers:** Argentina and Brazil (169 each, rank 16), Mexico (157, rank 21), Uruguay (156, rank 22), Costa Rica and Panama (148, rank 26)
- **U.S. decline:** Falling from 1st place in 2014 to 10th in 2026 represents a remarkable long-term weakening, driven by shifting bilateral agreements and tightening reciprocal arrangements.

### Middle East

The region shows the most dramatic contrasts.

- **Strongest:** UAE (184, rank 5) — the standout global performer over two decades
- **Mid-tier:** Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain maintain moderate access
- **Weakest:** Iraq (31), Syria (29), Yemen (35), and Palestinian Territory (40) are among the world's least powerful passports

The UAE's transformation from 62nd to 5th over 20 years stands as the most remarkable passport power story in history, adding 149 destinations through aggressive diplomatic engagement.

### Africa

Africa remains the most challenging region for passport mobility, with only three countries placing in the global top 50.

- **Strongest:** Seychelles (154, rank 24 globally) — Africa's standout performer, driven by tourism-focused foreign policy and reciprocal agreements
- **Mid-tier:** Mauritius (rank 28-30 globally), South Africa (101 destinations, rank 48 globally)
- **Weakest:** Somalia (36), Libya (40), Sudan (46)

Seychelles demonstrates that even small nations can achieve significant passport power through targeted diplomatic engagement. Its tourism-dependent economy has created strong incentives for visa liberalization.

## How Passport Power Affects Your Travel Planning

Your passport ranking has real, practical consequences for how you plan and experience travel.

### Visa-Free Destinations: Just Book and Go

If you hold a top-10 passport, most of the world is available on short notice. Weekend trip to Tokyo? Book a flight. Month in Europe? No paperwork. This spontaneity is a privilege that passport power directly enables.

### Visa-on-Arrival: Minor Planning Required

Many destinations offer visas on arrival for passports that don't qualify for visa-free entry. This usually means filling out a form and paying a fee at the airport (typically $20-$50). You can still be relatively spontaneous, but carry passport photos and the correct fee in cash.

### Pre-Arranged Visas: Time and Money

For destinations requiring advance visas, you need to plan weeks or months ahead. Embassy appointments, supporting documents (bank statements, hotel bookings, return flights), and fees ($50-$200+) are standard. Some visas take 4-8 weeks to process.

### Restricted Travel: Significant Barriers

Some passport-destination combinations are effectively blocked. Holders of certain bottom-10 passports may need to provide extensive documentation, undergo interviews, and still face high rejection rates.

### Financial Impact

Visa costs add up fast. A traveler visiting 10 countries might spend $0 in visa fees with a Singaporean passport and $500-$1,000 with a lower-ranked one. Processing times also force longer planning horizons, making last-minute travel deals inaccessible.

**This is exactly where tools like MonkeyTravel come in.** When you're planning a multi-country trip, MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner helps you map out an itinerary that accounts for logistics and practical realities — so you spend your time exploring, not researching paperwork.

## Post-COVID Trends Reshaping Passport Power

The pandemic fundamentally altered global mobility, and its aftereffects continue to shape the 2026 landscape.

### The Widening Mobility Gap

The gap between the world's strongest and weakest passports grew from 153 destinations in 2020 to 168 in 2026. Countries that were already at the bottom saw their access further restricted as nations implemented new health-related entry requirements that were never fully rolled back.

### Western Passports Are Declining

The U.S. and UK — which jointly held 1st place in 2014 — are now at 10th and 7th respectively. Both lost more visa-free destinations in 2025-2026 than in any previous year. Factors include:

- Tightened reciprocity arrangements (countries removing visa-free access for U.S./UK citizens when their own citizens face U.S./UK visa requirements)
- New entry systems like the EU's ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), which adds a layer of pre-authorization even for visa-exempt travelers
- Geopolitical shifts affecting bilateral agreements

### Digital Nomad Visas Are Changing the Game

Post-COVID, dozens of countries introduced digital nomad visas that bypass traditional passport power hierarchies. Countries like Portugal, Spain, Thailand, Colombia, and Indonesia now offer long-stay visas for remote workers regardless of passport ranking. This represents a new dimension of mobility not fully captured by passport indexes.

### The Rise of Electronic Travel Authorizations

ETAs — required pre-travel authorizations similar to the U.S. ESTA — are expanding. The UK, Canada, and the EU (via ETIAS) now require or are implementing ETAs for visa-free travelers. While these are not visas (they are usually quick and cheap), they add a planning step that didn't exist pre-COVID.

### Asian Passports Continue to Rise

The dominance of Singapore, Japan, and South Korea at the top of the rankings reflects a broader trend: Asian passports have steadily gained power while Western ones have plateaued or declined. Malaysia at rank 9 is another example, outranking many European nations outside the EU.

## Tips for Travelers With Weaker Passports

If your passport doesn't rank in the top 20, international travel requires more strategy — but it is far from impossible. Here is how to maximize your mobility.

### 1. Target Visa-on-Arrival and E-Visa Destinations

Many countries offer simplified entry for passports that don't qualify for visa-free access. E-Visa systems (applied and approved online, often within 48-72 hours) have expanded dramatically since 2020. Countries like Turkey, India, Kenya, Ethiopia, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka all offer e-Visas to most nationalities.

### 2. Build a Travel History

Consulates reviewing visa applications look favorably on applicants with established travel histories. Start with easier-to-obtain visas, then use that stamp-filled passport to support applications for more restrictive destinations.

### 3. Consider Second Citizenship or Residency

Citizenship-by-investment programs in countries like Portugal, Malta, Turkey, and several Caribbean nations can provide a second passport with significantly higher rankings. Long-term residency in EU countries can also eventually lead to citizenship and an EU passport.

### 4. Apply for Multi-Entry and Long-Duration Visas

When you do go through the visa process, always apply for the longest duration and multi-entry options available. A 5-year multiple-entry U.S. B1/B2 visa, for example, eliminates repeated applications.

### 5. Use Transit Hubs Strategically

Some countries offer visa-free transit for 24-72 hours. China, for example, offers 72-144 hour visa-free transit in many cities for holders of passports from over 50 countries. This can turn a layover into a mini-trip.

### 6. Join Trusted Traveler Programs

Programs like Global Entry (U.S.), NEXUS (U.S.-Canada), and the UK's Registered Traveller scheme can simplify border crossings even for travelers from countries with weaker passports.

### 7. Plan Further Ahead

With a lower-ranked passport, spontaneous travel is harder. Give yourself 2-3 months for visa processing and always have your documentation ready: bank statements, employment letters, hotel bookings, and travel insurance.

**Regardless of your passport's ranking, MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner can help you build detailed itineraries tailored to your destinations.** It handles the logistics — optimal routing, local recommendations, budget planning — so you can focus on the experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How often is the Passport Power Index updated?

The Henley Passport Index is updated quarterly, with major reports published in January. The Arton Capital Passport Index is updated in real-time as visa policy changes are announced. Rankings can shift throughout the year as bilateral agreements are signed or revoked.

### 2. Does a higher-ranked passport guarantee entry to more countries?

Not exactly. A higher rank means more visa-free or visa-on-arrival access, but entry is never guaranteed. Immigration officers can still deny entry for reasons like insufficient funds, missing return tickets, or overstaying previous visits. The ranking reflects the visa requirement — not an absolute right of entry.

### 3. Can my passport ranking change without me doing anything?

Yes. Your passport's rank changes as your government negotiates (or loses) bilateral visa agreements. For example, the U.S. dropped out of the top 10 briefly in late 2025 due to several countries imposing new visa requirements on American citizens. You can also gain access through new agreements — the UAE added 149 destinations over 20 years.

### 4. Why do Japan and Singapore consistently rank so high?

Both countries combine strong economies, political stability, low rates of visa overstay, and highly active diplomatic engagement focused on travel facilitation. Their citizens are perceived as low-risk travelers, which makes other countries more willing to grant visa-free access.

### 5. Is there a way to improve my travel mobility without changing citizenship?

Yes. E-Visas, visa-on-arrival programs, digital nomad visas, transit visas, and trusted traveler programs all expand your effective mobility beyond what the raw passport ranking suggests. Building a strong travel history, maintaining solid financial documentation, and applying for multi-entry visas also help significantly.

## The Bottom Line

The 2026 Passport Power Index reveals a world where mobility inequality is at an all-time high. The 168-destination gap between Singapore and Afghanistan represents the starkest divide in the index's history, and the trends — Western decline, Asian ascendance, the UAE's diplomatic transformation — show that passport power is not static.

For travelers, the practical takeaway is clear: know your passport's power, plan accordingly, and take advantage of every tool available to simplify the process. Whether your passport opens 195 doors or 27, the world is still out there waiting.

Understanding where your passport stands is the first step in planning smarter. From there, it is about building the right itinerary for the access you have — and that is exactly what good travel planning tools are designed to do.
