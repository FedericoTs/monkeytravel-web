# London 4-Day Itinerary: The Practical Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Four days in London is the sweet spot. Enough time to hit the icons — Big Ben, the Tower, the museums — and still wander into a pub that's been pouring pints since before your country existed. Not enough time to see everything, but enough to feel like you actually lived here for a minute.

This itinerary is built on real Tube connections, actual 2026 prices, and honest walking times. London is deceptively spread out — neighborhoods that look close on a map can be 40 minutes apart on foot. The Tube is your lifeline, and knowing which lines to take saves you hours over four days.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Around — The Oyster Card & Contactless

Forget paper tickets. You have two options:

- **Contactless bank card or phone:** Just tap in and tap out at Tube gates. The system auto-caps your daily spend at £8.10 (Zones 1-2), so you'll never pay more than that in a day. This is the easiest option for most visitors.
- **Oyster card:** £7 refundable deposit, then load pay-as-you-go credit. Same daily cap of £8.10. Useful if you don't want to use your bank card or if your contactless card charges foreign transaction fees.

**Single Tube rides** in Zones 1-2 cost £2.80 peak / £2.70 off-peak. Buses are £1.75 flat regardless of distance. A typical sightseeing day involves 4-6 Tube rides, costing £6-8 before the cap kicks in.

> **Pro tip:** The daily cap resets at 4:30 AM, not midnight. If you're out late, your night rides count toward the current day's cap.

### From the Airport

**From Heathrow (LHR):**
- **Tube (Piccadilly Line):** 50-60 minutes to central London, £5.50. Cheap but slow, and no seat is guaranteed during peak hours.
- **Heathrow Express:** 15 minutes to Paddington, £25 advance / £32 walk-up. Worth it if your hotel is near Paddington or you're exhausted.
- **Elizabeth Line:** 30-40 minutes to Paddington/Liverpool Street, £12.80. Best balance of speed and price — opened in 2022 and still underused by tourists.

**From Gatwick (LGW):**
- **Gatwick Express:** 30 minutes to Victoria, £19.90 advance.
- **Southern/Thameslink trains:** 35-45 minutes, £12-16. Slower but cheaper and often less crowded.

**From Stansted (STN):**
- **Stansted Express:** 47 minutes to Liverpool Street, £17-23.

### Budget Breakdown

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hotel/night | £70-120 | £150-280 | £350+ |
| Food/day | £25-45 | £50-100 | £130+ |
| Transport/day | £6-9 | £8-15 | £25+ (taxis) |
| Activities/day | £0-20 | £25-60 | £80+ |
| **Daily Total** | **£101-194** | **£233-455** | **£585+** |

London's biggest advantage: many of the world's greatest museums are **completely free**. The British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern, V&A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum — all free. This makes London one of the best-value cultural destinations on Earth, despite its reputation as expensive.

---

## Day 1: Westminster, Big Ben & the South Bank

### Morning: Westminster Walk (9:00 AM)

Start at **Westminster Tube station** (Jubilee, District, and Circle lines). When you exit, Big Ben is right there — the Elizabeth Tower and the Houses of Parliament fill the skyline. Take it in. Every Londoner walks past it daily and still glances up.

Walk across **Westminster Bridge** for the classic photo angle — Parliament on one side, the London Eye on the other. This takes 5 minutes and costs nothing, yet it's one of London's most iconic views.

Double back to **Parliament Square** to see the statues of Churchill, Mandela, Gandhi, and Lincoln. Then walk 5 minutes down the road to **Westminster Abbey**.

- **Westminster Abbey tickets:** £29 adults (book online for timed entry at westminster-abbey.org). Free for services — Evensong at 5:00 PM most weekdays is a stunning way to experience the Abbey without the entrance fee.
- **Hours:** 9:30 AM - 3:30 PM (last entry). Closed Sundays except for services.
- **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours

> **Money-saving tip:** If you're not deeply interested in the abbey's interior, skip the paid entry and attend Evensong instead. The music is world-class and the atmosphere more meaningful than a daytime tourist visit.

### Late Morning: St James's Park & Buckingham Palace (11:00 AM)

Walk through **St James's Park** — London's oldest Royal Park and genuinely one of the prettiest city parks in Europe. The lake, the pelicans (yes, pelicans — they've been here since 1664), and the views toward Buckingham Palace are free and uncrowded on weekday mornings.

Arrive at **Buckingham Palace** by 11:00 AM. The **Changing of the Guard** ceremony happens at 11:00 AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays (daily in summer). Get there 30 minutes early for a decent view — the railings fill up fast.

- **State Rooms (summer only, July-September):** £33 adults. Stunning interiors. Book online in advance.
- **Free option:** Watch the guards from the Mall or the Victoria Memorial. The ceremony lasts about 45 minutes.

### Lunch: Near Buckingham Palace / Victoria (12:30 PM)

- **The Vincent Rooms** (Vincent Square, 10-minute walk): A hidden gem — Westminster Kingsway College's training restaurant where future chefs cook fine dining at canteen prices. 2-course lunch £15-18. Seriously underrated.
- **Regency Café** (Regency Street): Classic greasy spoon with Art Deco interiors. Full English breakfast or pie and mash for £8-12. Cash only, queue expected.
- **Pimlico market stalls** along Tachbrook Street: Street food, delis, and bakeries. Grab a sandwich for £5-7.

### Afternoon: South Bank & the London Eye (2:00 PM)

Walk or take the Tube one stop to Waterloo. The **South Bank** stretches along the Thames from Westminster Bridge to Tower Bridge and is one of London's best free walks.

**The London Eye:**
- **Tickets:** £34 adults (book online for 10% off). Fast-track: £46.
- **Time needed:** 30-minute rotation
- **Worth it?** On a clear day, the views are spectacular — you can see 25 miles. On a cloudy day, save your money.

Continue east along the South Bank past the **Southbank Centre** (free exhibitions and live music in the foyer), the **BFI** (if it's raining, check what's screening), and **Shakespeare's Globe**.

- **Globe Theatre tour:** £18.50 adults, 40 minutes. Surprisingly fascinating even if you're not into Shakespeare.
- **Globe performances (April-October):** Groundling standing tickets are just £5 — one of London's best entertainment deals.

### Evening: Tate Modern & Borough Market Area (5:00 PM)

**Tate Modern** is free and open until 6:00 PM (10:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays). Even if modern art isn't your thing, go up to the viewing level for free panoramic views of St Paul's Cathedral and the City skyline.

For dinner, walk 10 minutes to the **Borough Market area** (the market itself closes at 5:00 PM, but the surrounding restaurants stay open).

- **Padella** (handmade pasta, mains £7-14, expect a 30-60 minute queue — worth every minute)
- **El Pastor** (Borough Yards): Incredible tacos, £4-6 each. The al pastor is legendary.
- **The Anchor Bankside** (pub): Historic pub on the Thames with outdoor terrace. Pints £6-7, pub food £12-18.

Walk along the Thames after dark. St Paul's Cathedral and the Shard are lit up, the Millennium Bridge glows, and the whole river feels cinematic.

---

## Day 2: The British Museum, Covent Garden & the West End

### Morning: The British Museum (9:30 AM)

The British Museum is free, enormous, and impossible to see in a single visit. Don't try. Pick a strategy:

- **The highlights route (2 hours):** Rosetta Stone (Room 4), Elgin Marbles (Room 18), Egyptian mummies (Rooms 62-63), Assyrian lion hunt reliefs (Room 10). These alone justify a visit.
- **Deep dive (3-4 hours):** Add the Enlightenment Gallery, Aztec turquoise mosaic, and the stunning Great Court (the largest covered public square in Europe).

- **Entry:** Free (donations welcome)
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM daily (until 8:30 PM on Fridays). Arrive at opening — it gets crowded by 11:30 AM.
- **Timed entry:** Free but recommended — book at britishmuseum.org

> **Strategy tip:** Enter through the Montague Place entrance on the back side. The main Great Russell Street entrance has the longest queue. The back entrance puts you right near the Egyptian galleries.

### Lunch: Bloomsbury to Covent Garden (12:30 PM)

Walk 15 minutes south from the British Museum to Covent Garden through **Bloomsbury**, London's literary and academic district. If you're a bookworm, detour to the original **Waterstones Gower Street** (one of London's best bookshops) or **The London Review Bookshop** on Bury Place.

In Covent Garden:

- **Dishoom** (original location, off Long Acre): Bombay-style brunch/lunch. Black daal and bacon naan roll are legendary. £12-18 per person. Expect a queue — put your name down early or try a walk-in at off-peak times.
- **Flat Iron** (Henrietta Street): Superb flat-iron steak with unlimited salad for £14. The best value steak in London.
- **Food stalls in the market:** Various vendors in the lower level, £6-10 for a full meal.

### Afternoon: Covent Garden & Soho (2:00 PM)

**Covent Garden Piazza** itself is touristy but fun — world-class street performers, the Apple Market (arts and crafts), and the **London Transport Museum** (£21, surprisingly excellent, especially with kids).

Walk 10 minutes west into **Soho** — London's entertainment, food, and nightlife epicenter. Highlights:

- **Chinatown** (Gerrard Street): London's compact Chinatown. Grab dim sum at **Joy King Lau** (£15-22 per person) or hand-pulled noodles at **Xi'an Impression** (£10-14).
- **Carnaby Street:** Beyond the tourist facade, the side streets (Kingly Court, Newburgh Quarter) have excellent independent shops and restaurants.
- **Berwick Street Market:** Small but atmospheric food stalls and vintage vinyl shops.

### Evening: West End Show (7:00 PM)

London's West End is second only to Broadway — and tickets are often cheaper.

- **Full-price tickets:** £25-150 depending on the show and seat. Book at the official show websites.
- **TKTS booth** (Leicester Square): Same-day discounted tickets for major shows, 20-50% off. Queue from 10:00 AM for best selection. No booking fees.
- **Rush/lottery tickets:** Many shows offer £20-25 front-row tickets via daily lottery on the TodayTix app. Check the morning of your visit.

> **Best current shows (2026):** Check londontheatre.co.uk for the latest lineup. West End shows change frequently. Book at least a week ahead for popular shows.

Pre-theatre dinner near the theatres:

- **Flat Iron** (Denmark Street): Same great steak, Soho location. £14 for steak and salad.
- **Bao** (Soho): Taiwanese steamed buns, £4-5 each. Small plates, big flavors. Budget £15-20 per person.
- **Barrafina** (Dean Street): Outstanding Spanish tapas at the counter. £25-40 per person. No reservations — just queue.

---

## Day 3: Tower of London, Borough Market, Shoreditch & Camden

### Morning: Tower of London (9:00 AM)

Get there at opening. The Tower of London is one of those rare tourist attractions that actually lives up to the hype — 1,000 years of history in a single fortress.

- **Tickets:** £33.60 adults (book online at hrp.org.uk for slight discount). Audio guide included.
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM (summer), 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM (winter). Last entry 1 hour before closing.
- **Time needed:** 2.5-3 hours

**Must-see inside:**
- **Crown Jewels:** Go here first. The queue builds to 60+ minutes by mid-morning. At 9:00 AM, you walk straight in.
- **White Tower:** The 1066 original, with a stunning collection of royal armor and weaponry.
- **Yeoman Warder tours:** Free with admission, hourly from 10:00 AM. These Beefeater-led tours are funny, informative, and the best way to experience the Tower.

### Late Morning: Tower Bridge (11:30 AM)

Walk 5 minutes to **Tower Bridge**. Crossing the bridge is free and the views in both directions are excellent. The Tower Bridge Exhibition (glass-floor walkways and engine rooms) costs £12.30 — interesting but not essential.

### Lunch: Borough Market (12:30 PM)

Take the Tube from Tower Hill to London Bridge (2 stops on the District/Circle line) or walk 15 minutes along the riverfront.

**Borough Market** is London's best food market. It's open Wednesday to Saturday (full market), and the stalls are best experienced for lunch.

- **Kappacasein** raclette: Melted Swiss cheese scraped over potatoes and pickles. £8. The queue is part of the experience.
- **Bread Ahead** doughnuts: Warm, filled, and unfairly good. £4-5 each.
- **Gourmet Goat** wraps: Slow-cooked goat shoulder in flatbread. £9-11.
- **Monmouth Coffee** (Monmouth's original shop): Some of the best coffee in London. £3-4.
- Budget a total of **£12-20** for a full market lunch grazing across multiple stalls.

> **Timing tip:** Arrive before 12:00 for manageable crowds. By 1:00 PM on Saturdays, Borough Market is shoulder-to-shoulder.

### Afternoon: Shoreditch & Brick Lane (2:30 PM)

Take the Overground from London Bridge to Shoreditch High Street (10 minutes). **Shoreditch** is London's creative hub — street art, vintage shops, craft coffee, and some of the city's best food.

**What to see:**
- **Brick Lane:** Walk the full length. Street art, curry houses (the famous "Brick Lane curry" — stick to places with actual queues, not the men handing out flyers), vintage markets, and the **Old Truman Brewery** complex with rotating pop-ups and markets (weekends).
- **Boxpark Shoreditch:** Shipping container food market. Dozens of vendors, £7-12 per dish.
- **Columbia Road Flower Market** (Sundays only, 8:00 AM - 3:00 PM): One of London's most photogenic markets. Worth rearranging your itinerary if you're here on a Sunday.

### Evening: Camden Town (5:30 PM)

Take the Northern Line from Old Street to Camden Town (20 minutes). Camden is London's alternative heart — punk rock, goth fashion, canal boats, and chaotic market energy.

**Camden Market** (open daily until 6:00 PM, some food stalls until 7:00 PM+) sprawls across several interconnected markets. The food stalls in **Camden Lock Market** and **Buck Street Market** offer cuisines from around the world:

- Jerk chicken and plantain (£8-10)
- Pad Thai cooked in front of you (£7-9)
- Argentine steaks (£10-14)
- Mac and cheese balls (£6-8)

After eating, walk along **Regent's Canal** toward **Primrose Hill** for a stunning sunset view over the London skyline (free, 15-minute walk). On a clear evening, you can see the Shard, the Eye, the Gherkin, and St Paul's dome from the hilltop.

For drinks after sunset, head back to Camden for the pubs:

- **The Hawley Arms** (Amy Winehouse's former local): Indie jukebox, pints £6-7, pub quiz nights.
- **BrewDog Camden:** Craft beer with a good terrace overlooking the market.
- **The Jazz Cafe:** Live jazz and soul nightly. Tickets £8-25 depending on the act.

## Day 4: Notting Hill, Hyde Park, Kensington Museums & Afternoon Tea

### Morning: Notting Hill & Portobello Road (9:00 AM)

Take the Central Line to **Notting Hill Gate**. If it's Saturday, you're in luck — **Portobello Road Market** is in full swing.

- **Portobello Road Market (Saturday):** Antiques, vintage clothes, street food, and bric-a-brac stretching for over a mile. Arrive by 9:00 AM for the antiques dealers at the Notting Hill end before they pack up.
- **Non-Saturday:** The permanent shops and cafés along Portobello Road are open daily. Quieter and still charming — you'll see the pastel-colored houses that made this street famous.

Walk the colorful streets of Notting Hill. **Lancaster Road** and **Westbourne Park Road** have the most photogenic houses. Stop for coffee at **Coffee Plant** or breakfast at **Farm Girl Cafe** (acai bowls and brunches, £10-16).

### Late Morning: Hyde Park & Kensington Gardens (11:00 AM)

Walk south into **Hyde Park** — 350 acres of green in the middle of London. Key spots:

- **Speakers' Corner** (northeast, near Marble Arch): Sunday mornings feature soapbox orators debating everything from politics to philosophy. Free entertainment.
- **The Serpentine:** The lake running through the park. Rent a pedalo in summer (£14/hour for 4 people) or just walk the shoreline.
- **Kensington Palace:** Home of the Prince and Princess of Wales. State rooms open to the public for £21 — worth it if you're into royal history.
- **Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain:** A unique circular water feature. Free.

### Lunch: Kensington (1:00 PM)

- **V&A Café** (inside the V&A Museum): Widely considered the most beautiful museum café in the world. Located in ornate Victorian rooms with tiled walls and stained glass. Sandwiches £6-9, hot dishes £10-14.
- **Fernandez & Wells** (Exhibition Road): Excellent sandwiches and coffee. £7-10 for lunch.
- **Comptoir Libanais** (Exhibition Road): Lebanese sharing plates and wraps. £10-15 per person. Quick and flavorful.

### Afternoon: The Kensington Museums (2:00 PM)

Three world-class museums sit side by side on Exhibition Road — and all are **free**.

**Pick one or two based on your interests:**

**Natural History Museum:**
- Iconic Romanesque building. The Hintze Hall with the blue whale skeleton is breathtaking.
- Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition (£17, if running during your visit) is consistently excellent.
- Time needed: 1.5-2 hours for highlights.

**Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A):**
- The world's greatest museum of art and design. Fashion, ceramics, sculpture, photography, theater — staggeringly broad.
- Don't miss the Cast Courts (Room 46) — full-size plaster replicas of Trajan's Column and Michelangelo's David.
- Time needed: 1.5-2 hours.

**Science Museum:**
- Best for families and curious adults. The Flight gallery, space exploration section, and Wonderlab (interactive, £11) are standouts.
- Time needed: 1-2 hours.

> **All three are free for permanent collections.** Special exhibitions may have charges. Budget 2-3 hours total if you're doing two museums, or 4 hours if you want to explore more deeply.

### Late Afternoon: Afternoon Tea (4:00 PM)

Afternoon tea is the quintessential London experience. Options at every budget:

**Classic:**
- **The Orangery at Kensington Palace:** Afternoon tea from £38 per person. Royal setting in the palace grounds. Book 2-3 weeks ahead.
- **Fortnum & Mason** (Piccadilly): London's most famous department store tea. £60-75 per person. Grand and traditional.

**Mid-range:**
- **Sketch** (Mayfair): The pink room is Instagram-famous. Afternoon tea £49. Book well ahead.
- **The Wolseley** (Piccadilly): European grand café feel. Afternoon tea £38.50. Elegant without being stuffy.

**Budget-friendly:**
- **Fan of Tea** (Kensington): Full afternoon tea for £25 per person. Charming and unpretentious.
- **Any Caffè Concerto location:** Afternoon tea for £22-28. Chain but decent quality and multiple central locations.

> Afternoon tea typically includes finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and a selection of pastries. Most places offer vegetarian and gluten-free options — mention dietary needs when booking.

### Evening: Final Night Options

Choose your final London evening:

- **South Kensington pubs:** The **Hereford Arms** or **Queen's Arms** for a proper pint in a residential neighborhood. Less touristy, more local. Pints £6-7.
- **Kensington Roof Gardens / rooftop bars:** Several rooftop bars in the area with views. Cocktails £12-16.
- **West End encore:** If you didn't catch a show on Day 2, tonight's your backup. TKTS same-day deals are available until 7:00 PM.
- **Thames dinner cruise:** Various operators, from £40 for a basic dinner cruise to £100+ for premium. Book on City Cruises or Bateaux London.

## How Much Does 4 Days in London Cost?

Here's a realistic budget for 4 days, per person:

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Accommodation (4 nights) | £280-480 | £600-1,120 |
| Food (4 days) | £100-180 | £200-400 |
| Transport (Oyster/contactless) | £25-35 | £35-60 |
| Activities | £35-80 | £100-200 |
| **Total** | **£440-775** | **£935-1,780** |

**Money-saving tips:**
- The free museums alone could fill 3 days of sightseeing. Plan around these and you'll save hundreds on entry fees.
- Eat your big meal at lunch — many restaurants offer set lunch menus at 30-50% less than dinner prices.
- Drink in pubs, not cocktail bars. A pint of good beer costs £5-7 vs. £13-16 for a cocktail.
- Get an **Oyster card** or use contactless — never buy single paper tickets, which cost nearly double.
- Supermarket meal deals (Tesco, Sainsbury's, M&S) give you a sandwich, snack, and drink for £3.50-5. Perfect for a quick lunch in a park.
- Walk the South Bank instead of paying for a river cruise. You see the same landmarks for free.

## FAQ

### Is 4 days enough for London?

Four days covers the major landmarks (Westminster, Tower of London, British Museum), key neighborhoods (Soho, Shoreditch, Camden, Notting Hill), and still leaves room for markets, museums, and evening entertainment. For a deeper dive — adding Greenwich, Hampton Court, or day trips — budget 5-7 days.

### What is the best area to stay in London?

**South Kensington / Earl's Court** offers the best balance: central location, direct Tube to Heathrow, close to Hyde Park and the museums, and more residential (meaning cheaper and quieter) than the West End. **King's Cross / St Pancras** is excellent for transport connections and has transformed into a vibrant neighborhood. **Shoreditch** suits younger travelers who want nightlife and street culture. Avoid staying too far out on the Tube — anything in Zones 1-2 keeps commute times under 20 minutes.

### Is London really that expensive?

The biggest museums are free — that's the key advantage London has over Paris, Rome, or New York. Accommodation and dining are expensive, yes. But by eating at markets, pubs, and supermarket meal deals, and filling your days with free museums and parks, you can do London on £100-190 per day including accommodation. That's comparable to most European capitals.

### Do I need to book attractions in advance?

For the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, and the London Eye — yes, book online for cheaper tickets and to guarantee entry. The British Museum, Tate Modern, V&A, and Natural History Museum are free and don't require booking (though timed-entry helps during peak weekends). West End shows should be booked at least a few days ahead, though TKTS offers same-day discounts.

### What's the best time of year to visit London?

May to September offers the best weather (15-25°C), longest daylight, and outdoor events (Wimbledon, Notting Hill Carnival in August, rooftop bars). April and October are shoulder season — cooler but fewer crowds and lower hotel prices. Winter (November-February) is cold and dark but magical during Christmas markets and holiday lights. London is a year-round city — there's no bad time, just different experiences.
