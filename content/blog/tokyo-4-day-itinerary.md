# Tokyo 4-Day Itinerary: The Practical Day-by-Day Guide for 2026

Four days in Tokyo sounds short until you realize how efficiently this city moves. The train network is so precise that a 10-minute transfer is generous. Neighborhoods that feel worlds apart are 8 minutes by subway. And unlike most capitals, you can eat incredibly well for $8.

This itinerary is built on real metro connections, actual 2026 prices, and honest timing. No "just wander and soak it in" — Tokyo is too big and too dense for that approach. You need a plan, and then you need the freedom to break it when a back-alley ramen shop catches your eye.

## Before You Go: The Practical Stuff

### Getting Around — IC Cards Are Everything

Your first move at Narita or Haneda airport: get a **Suica** or **Pasmo** IC card. These rechargeable cards work on every train, subway, bus, convenience store, and vending machine in Tokyo. Tap in, tap out. No fumbling for tickets.

- **Suica:** Available at JR ticket machines. Load 3,000-5,000 yen ($20-33) to start.
- **Pasmo:** Available at Tokyo Metro ticket machines. Functionally identical to Suica.
- **Mobile Suica:** If you have an iPhone, add a Suica directly to Apple Wallet. No physical card needed.

**Single subway rides** cost ¥170-320 ($1.10-2.10) depending on distance. A typical day of sightseeing involves 4-6 rides, costing $5-10 in transit.

### Do You Need a JR Pass?

**For a Tokyo-only trip: no.** The Japan Rail Pass ($375 for 7 days) only makes sense if you're taking 3+ long-distance bullet trains. For 4 days in Tokyo, individual subway rides on your IC card are far cheaper. You'll spend $6-10/day on trains.

If you're adding Kamakura as a day trip (Day 4 in this itinerary), the round-trip JR fare is about ¥1,900 ($12.50). Still doesn't justify the pass.

### Airport to City Center

**From Narita (NRT):**
- **Narita Express (N'EX):** 60 minutes to Tokyo Station, ¥3,250 ($21). Most reliable option.
- **Skyliner:** 45 minutes to Ueno/Nippori, ¥2,570 ($17). Best if your hotel is in eastern Tokyo.
- **Airport Limousine Bus:** 85-120 minutes, ¥3,200 ($21). Direct to major hotels — worth it if you're jet-lagged and hauling luggage.

**From Haneda (HND):**
- **Tokyo Monorail:** 20 minutes to Hamamatsucho, ¥500 ($3.30). Ridiculously cheap.
- **Keikyu Line:** 20 minutes to Shinagawa, ¥300 ($2). Even cheaper.

### Budget Breakdown

| Expense | Budget | Mid-Range | Splurge |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hotel/night | ¥5,000-10,000 ($33-66) | ¥15,000-30,000 ($100-200) | ¥40,000+ ($265+) |
| Food/day | ¥2,000-4,000 ($13-26) | ¥5,000-10,000 ($33-66) | ¥15,000+ ($100+) |
| Transport/day | ¥800-1,500 ($5-10) | ¥1,500-2,500 ($10-17) | ¥3,000+ ($20+) |
| Activities/day | ¥1,000-2,500 ($7-17) | ¥3,000-6,000 ($20-40) | ¥8,000+ ($53+) |
| **Daily Total** | **$58-119** | **$163-323** | **$438+** |

Yes, you read that right. Tokyo on a budget is surprisingly affordable — cheaper than London or Paris by a wide margin.

## Day 1: Shibuya & Shinjuku — Tokyo's Electric Heart

### Morning: Meiji Shrine (9:00 AM)

Start your Tokyo trip with calm before the storm. **Meiji Shrine (Meiji Jingū)** sits in a 175-acre forest in the middle of the city. The walk through the towering torii gates and old-growth trees feels like stepping out of Tokyo entirely.

- **Entry:** Free
- **Hours:** Sunrise to sunset (roughly 6:00 AM - 5:00 PM in winter, until 6:30 PM in summer)
- **Time needed:** 45-60 minutes

Walk from the shrine's south exit directly into Harajuku (you'll come back to explore on Day 3) and take the JR Yamanote Line one stop to Shibuya.

### Late Morning: Shibuya Crossing (10:30 AM)

The world's busiest pedestrian crossing. Up to 3,000 people cross simultaneously every light change. Stand at the **Shibuya Sky** observation deck for the aerial view, or watch from the Starbucks on the 2nd floor of the Tsutaya building (free with a coffee purchase).

- **Shibuya Sky:** ¥2,000 ($13). Book online — walk-ups sell out. The rooftop at 230 meters is one of Tokyo's best observation points.
- **Hachiko Statue:** Right outside Shibuya Station's Hachiko Exit. Quick photo stop.

Explore the backstreets behind Shibuya 109. **Nonbei Yokocho** (Drunkard's Alley) is a narrow lane of tiny bars, each seating 6-8 people. Great atmosphere even during the day.

### Lunch: Shibuya (12:30 PM)

- **Fuunji** (Shinjuku, if you want to start heading that way): Legendary tsukemen (dipping ramen). The line moves fast. ¥1,000-1,200 ($7-8).
- **Genki Sushi** (Shibuya): Conveyor belt sushi with tablet ordering. ¥1,200-2,000 ($8-13) for a full meal.
- **Any convenience store:** 7-Eleven onigiri ($1.20), bento boxes ($4-6). Seriously — Japanese convenience store food is a tier above anything you've experienced.

### Afternoon: Shinjuku Gyoen (2:00 PM)

Walk or take the train one stop to Shinjuku. **Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden** is a 144-acre oasis that blends Japanese, French, and English garden styles.

- **Entry:** ¥500 ($3.30)
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM (last entry 4:00 PM). Closed Mondays.
- **Time needed:** 1-2 hours

This is the best spot in Tokyo for cherry blossoms (late March - early April) and fall foliage (mid-November - early December). Even outside those seasons, it's a needed counterbalance to the sensory overload of the streets.

### Evening: Shinjuku & Golden Gai (5:30 PM)

Shinjuku at night is overwhelming in the best way. Start at the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building** observation deck for a free sunset view (closed some Mondays, check the schedule). Then dive into the neon chaos.

**Golden Gai** is a grid of six narrow alleys packed with 200+ tiny bars, most seating 4-8 people. Some charge a cover (¥500-1,000/$3-7), some don't. The vibe ranges from jazz to punk to quiet conversation with the owner.

**Rules:**
- Don't take photos inside bars without asking
- If a bar has a "members only" or "regulars" sign, respect it and try the next one
- One or two drinks per bar, then move on — that's the culture

For dinner, head to **Omoide Yokocho (Memory Lane)** near Shinjuku Station's west exit. Tiny stalls serving yakitori (grilled chicken skewers, ¥100-200 each), grilled offal, and beer. A full dinner with drinks: ¥2,000-3,000 ($13-20).

---

## Day 2: Asakusa, Akihabara & Ueno — Old Meets Hyper-Modern

### Morning: Senso-ji Temple & Asakusa (8:30 AM)

Get to **Senso-ji** early. Tokyo's oldest temple (founded 645 AD) is magical at 8:30 AM before tour groups arrive. Walk through the giant red **Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate)**, then down **Nakamise-dōri** — a 200-meter shopping street selling traditional snacks, fans, and souvenirs.

- **Entry:** Free
- **Nakamise must-tries:** Fresh ningyoyaki (custard cakes, ¥300), age-manju (fried sweet buns, ¥100), and melon pan (¥200)

Walk past the main hall to the quieter **Asakusa Shrine** next door. Then stroll along the **Sumida River** promenade with views of the **Tokyo Skytree** across the water.

**Optional:** Tokyo Skytree observation deck, ¥2,100-3,100 ($14-21). It's the tallest tower in the world (634m), but the queue is long. If you already did Shibuya Sky, you can skip this.

### Lunch: Asakusa (11:30 AM)

- **Asakusa Gyukatsu:** Deep-fried beef cutlet you cook to your preference on a hot stone. ¥1,500 ($10). There's usually a line — worth it.
- **Sometaro:** Cook-your-own okonomiyaki (savory pancake) on a tabletop griddle. ¥800-1,200 ($5-8). Fun, cheap, filling.
- **Daikokuya Tempura:** Crispy tempura over rice since 1887. ¥1,500-2,200 ($10-15).

### Afternoon: Akihabara (1:30 PM)

Take the Tsukuba Express (8 minutes) from Asakusa to **Akihabara** — Tokyo's electronics and anime district. Even if you're not into anime, the sensory overload is worth experiencing.

**What to see:**
- **Yodobashi Camera Akiba:** 9 floors of electronics, from cutting-edge gadgets to random curiosities. Tax-free shopping for tourists.
- **Mandarake Complex:** 8 floors of manga, anime, vintage toys, and collectibles. Even non-fans find it fascinating.
- **Super Potato:** Retro gaming paradise. Play vintage arcade games on the 5th floor (¥100 per game).
- **Arcade halls:** SEGA GiGO and other arcades have UFO catchers (crane games), rhythm games, and floors of vintage cabinets. Budget ¥500-1,000 for an hour of play.

### Late Afternoon: Ueno Park (4:00 PM)

Take the JR Yamanote Line two stops from Akihabara to **Ueno**. Ueno Park is Tokyo's museum district and a beautiful park in its own right.

If you pick one museum: **Tokyo National Museum** (¥1,000/$7). Japan's oldest and largest museum, covering 5,000 years of Japanese art and history. The main building alone takes 90 minutes.

If you want something lighter: walk through the park, see the **Shinobazu Pond** (covered in lotus flowers in summer), and grab a beer from a park vendor.

### Evening: Izakaya Night (6:30 PM)

Head to **Ameyoko Market** (Ameya-Yokocho), the bustling street market under the JR tracks between Ueno and Okachimachi stations. Street food stalls serve grilled seafood, kebabs, and candied fruits. Then pick an izakaya.

**Izakaya tips:**
- Order the **nomihodai** (all-you-can-drink) if available — usually ¥1,500-2,000 ($10-13) for 90-120 minutes. Beer, highballs, shochu.
- Share 5-6 small plates: edamame, karaage (fried chicken), gyoza, grilled fish, potato salad, yakitori. Budget ¥2,500-4,000 ($17-26) per person for food + drinks.
- Look for places with a picture menu or plastic food displays outside — these are tourist-friendly without being tourist traps.

## Day 3: Harajuku, Omotesando & Roppongi — Style, Art & Night Views

### Morning: Takeshita Street & Harajuku (10:00 AM)

**Takeshita-dōri** doesn't wake up early — most shops open at 10:00 or 11:00 AM. This 400-meter pedestrian street is Tokyo's youth fashion epicenter. Expect crepe shops, vintage stores, costumes, and people-watching that borders on performance art.

- **Rainbow cotton candy** from Totti Candy Factory (¥700/$5) — absurdly large, absurdly photogenic
- **Marion Crêpes:** Tokyo-style crêpes since 1976. ¥500-800 ($3-5)
- **Daiso Harajuku:** 5 floors of ¥100 ($0.70) items. Great for quirky souvenirs.

### Late Morning: Omotesando (11:30 AM)

Walk from Takeshita-dōri to **Omotesando**, Tokyo's answer to the Champs-Élysées. The tree-lined boulevard is an open-air architecture gallery — flagship stores by Tadao Ando (Omotesando Hills), Kengo Kuma (Sunny Hills), and Herzog & de Meuron (Prada).

Duck into the backstreets of **Ura-Harajuku** (behind Omotesando) for independent boutiques, specialty coffee, and vintage shops. **Omotesando Koffee** (now called Koffee Mameya) serves single-origin pour-overs from ¥500 ($3.30).

### Lunch: Cat Street Area (1:00 PM)

**Cat Street** connects Harajuku to Shibuya through a winding pedestrian path lined with cafés and boutiques.

- **Afuri:** Yuzu-shio (citrus salt) ramen. Light, clean, addictive. ¥1,100-1,400 ($7-9).
- **Harajuku Gyoza Lou:** Perfectly crispy gyoza. ¥300 for 6 pieces. Get two orders and a beer.
- **Luke's Lobster Omotesando:** Lobster rolls, Tokyo edition. ¥1,500 ($10). Surprisingly legit.

### Afternoon: teamLab Borderless (2:30 PM)

**teamLab Borderless** moved to Azabudai Hills (Roppongi area) in 2024 and is now permanently housed in a stunning new space. This is a 10,000-square-meter digital art museum where projections flow across walls, floors, and between rooms. There's nothing else like it in the world.

- **Tickets:** ¥3,800 ($25) adults. **Book online at least 1 week ahead — it sells out daily.**
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM (varies seasonally)
- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours
- **Tip:** Wear dark clothing — you become part of the art. Avoid white, which reflects projections and washes out your photos.

### Evening: Tokyo Tower & Roppongi (6:00 PM)

Walk 15 minutes from Azabudai Hills to **Tokyo Tower**. The 1958 structure is the Eiffel Tower's orange cousin and arguably more photogenic at night.

- **Main deck (150m):** ¥1,200 ($8)
- **Top deck (250m):** ¥2,800 ($19) total. Book online.
- **Best free view of Tokyo Tower:** From the intersection near Shiba Park (Google "Tokyo Tower best photo spot Shiba Park")

For dinner in the area, **Gonpachi Nishi-Azabu** is the izakaya that inspired the restaurant scene in Kill Bill. Soba noodles, yakitori, and an atmospheric interior. ¥3,000-5,000 ($20-33) per person.

## Day 4: Kamakura Day Trip — Buddha, Bamboo & the Coast

Kamakura is Tokyo's best day trip: a coastal town with giant Buddhas, ancient temples, bamboo groves, and beaches — all 60 minutes south of the city.

### Getting There

Take the **JR Yokosuka Line** from Tokyo Station or Shinagawa directly to Kamakura Station. No transfers needed.

- **Travel time:** 55-60 minutes
- **Cost:** ¥950 ($6.25) each way. Use your IC card.
- **First train:** Depart by 8:00-8:30 AM to maximize your day.

### Morning: Great Buddha & Hase (9:30 AM)

From Kamakura Station, take the **Enoden Line** (a charming retro tram) three stops to **Hase Station** (¥200/$1.30).

**Kōtoku-in (Great Buddha)**
The 13.35-meter bronze Buddha has been sitting here since 1252. It survived tsunamis, typhoons, and earthquakes. It's smaller than you expect and more moving than you imagine.

- **Entry:** ¥300 ($2)
- **Go inside the Buddha:** ¥50 ($0.35). Yes, you can climb inside the hollow statue.
- **Time needed:** 30-45 minutes

Walk 10 minutes to **Hase-dera Temple** — perched on a hillside with ocean views, 2,500 hydrangeas (stunning in June), and a cave filled with small carved statues. Entry: ¥400 ($2.65).

### Late Morning: Bamboo Temple (11:00 AM)

Walk or bus to **Hōkoku-ji (Bamboo Temple)** — a Zen temple with a grove of 2,000 bamboo stalks. Drink matcha in the tea house overlooking the grove.

- **Entry:** ¥300 ($2). Matcha tea set: ¥600 ($4).
- **Time needed:** 30-45 minutes
- This is Kamakura's most photogenic spot. Go on a weekday if possible.

### Lunch: Kamakura Station Area (12:30 PM)

Head back to the Kamakura Station area for lunch.

- **Bowls:** Shirasu-don (whitebait rice bowl) is Kamakura's signature dish. Raw or boiled over rice. ¥1,000-1,500 ($7-10). Try it at **Akimoto** or **Tobiccho**.
- **Matsubara-an:** Handmade soba noodles in a traditional setting. ¥1,000-1,500 ($7-10).
- **Komachi-dōri Street:** Kamakura's main shopping street from the station to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine. Snack your way through — croquettes (¥200), soft-serve (¥350), sembei rice crackers (¥150).

### Afternoon: Tsurugaoka Hachimangu & Coastal Walk (1:30 PM)

**Tsurugaoka Hachimangu** is Kamakura's most important shrine, founded in 1063. Walk down the raised path (Dankazura) lined with cherry trees from the shrine back toward the station.

If the weather's good, take the **Enoden Line to Enoshima/Inamuragasaki** for coastal views. Walk along Yuigahama Beach with Enoshima Island in the distance and surfers in the water.

### Return to Tokyo (4:00-5:00 PM)

Take the JR Yokosuka Line back to Tokyo. You'll arrive by 5:00-6:00 PM with energy left for a final Tokyo evening.

**Last night ideas:**
- **Shibuya Scramble Crossing at night** — different energy after dark
- **Shinjuku's Robot Restaurant** is gone, but the **Kabukichō Tower** entertainment complex is the replacement. Explore the upper floors.
- **Convenience store dinner in your hotel** — no shame. Grab an egg sandwich, onigiri, and a Strong Zero from 7-Eleven. Total cost: $5. Peak Tokyo.

## How Much Does 4 Days in Tokyo Cost?

Here's a realistic budget for 4 days, per person:

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Accommodation (4 nights) | $130-265 | $400-800 |
| Food (4 days) | $52-105 | $130-265 |
| Transport (4 days + Kamakura) | $35-55 | $55-80 |

| **Total** | **$247-495** | **$665-1,305** |

**Money-saving tips:**
- Eat breakfast at convenience stores — ¥300-500 ($2-3.30) for an onigiri and coffee beats any hotel breakfast
- Fill your water bottle at stations and parks. Tokyo's tap water is safe and clean.
- Many temples and shrines are **free**. The paid ones are rarely more than $3-4.
- Hit **depachika** (department store basement food halls) after 7 PM for discounted prepared food
- Avoid taxis. The subway takes you everywhere for $1-2 per ride.

## FAQ

### Is 4 days enough for Tokyo?

Four days covers the essential neighborhoods (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Asakusa, Akihabara, Harajuku) plus a day trip. It's tight but doable if you plan well. For a more relaxed pace or to add Tsukiji, Odaiba, and Shimokitazawa, budget 5-6 days.

### What is the best area to stay in Tokyo?

Shinjuku offers the best balance: major train hub with access to everywhere, restaurants at every price point, and nightlife. Shibuya is great for younger travelers. Asakusa is cheaper and more traditional. For first-timers, Shinjuku is hard to beat.

### Is Tokyo expensive?

Less than you think. Budget travelers spend $60-120/day including accommodation. The weak yen in 2025-2026 makes Tokyo roughly 25-30% cheaper than 5 years ago for Western visitors. Food is where Tokyo really shines on value — $8 ramen that rivals $25 bowls in New York.

### Do I need to speak Japanese in Tokyo?

No. Tokyo's train system has full English signage. Major tourist areas, restaurants, and hotels have English menus and some English-speaking staff. Google Translate's camera mode handles everything else. Learning "sumimasen" (excuse me), "arigatou" (thank you), and pointing at the menu will carry you through 99% of situations.

### When is the best time to visit Tokyo?

Late March to mid-April for cherry blossoms — stunning but crowded. October to November for fall foliage and perfect temperatures (15-22°C). Skip Golden Week (late April to early May) and Obon (mid-August) when domestic travel peaks. Winter (December-February) is cold but clear, uncrowded, and excellent for food.
