# How to Plan a Trip with AI: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

Planning a trip used to mean dozens of browser tabs, spreadsheets that nobody updates, and 10+ hours of research just to figure out what to do for five days in a city you've never visited. Then you'd show the plan to your travel partner and they'd want to change half of it.

AI trip planning changes that. What used to take an entire weekend now takes under 15 minutes — and you end up with a better itinerary than most people build manually.

But if you've never used AI to plan a trip, the whole process can feel vague. What do you actually *do*? Where do you start? What do you type? What comes out?

This guide walks you through every step. By the end, you'll have a complete, day-by-day itinerary ready for your next trip. No experience required.

## Why AI Trip Planning Is Taking Over

The numbers tell the story. Over 42% of travelers used AI tools for trip planning in 2025, and that number is climbing fast. Among Gen Z and Millennials, it's already above 60%.

The reason is simple: AI does the tedious work instantly.

Think about what traditional trip planning actually involves:

- **Destination research** — reading blog posts, watching YouTube videos, asking friends (3-5 hours)
- **Building an itinerary** — figuring out what to do each day, in what order, without wasting time backtracking across the city (2-4 hours)
- **Finding restaurants** — reading hundreds of reviews, checking if they're open on your dates, fitting them geographically into your schedule (2-3 hours)
- **Budget math** — estimating costs per activity, balancing expensive days with cheaper ones, staying within your total budget (1-2 hours)
- **Logistics** — transit routes, opening hours, advance booking requirements, walking distances (1-2 hours)

That's 10-16 hours of work for a single trip. An AI trip planner does all of it in about 2 minutes. Not a rough outline — a full day-by-day itinerary with specific venues, time slots, prices, and smart routing.

Does it replace your judgment? No. You still decide what to keep, what to change, and what to skip. But it eliminates the blank-page problem. Instead of starting from zero, you start from a complete draft and refine it. That's a fundamentally different — and faster — way to plan.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

Before you open an AI trip planner, spend five minutes getting clear on the basics. The more specific your inputs, the better your AI itinerary will be.

Here's your quick checklist:

- **Destination** (or a shortlist of 2-3 options if you're undecided)
- **Travel dates** (even approximate ones help — "late April" is better than "sometime in spring")
- **Number of travelers** (solo, couple, group — this affects restaurant sizes, activity choices, and budget)
- **Budget range** (total trip budget, or a daily spending target)
- **Interests and priorities** (food, history, nature, nightlife, art, adventure, relaxation — pick your top 3)
- **Deal-breakers** (anything you want to avoid — long bus rides, extreme heat, crowded tourist traps)

You don't need all of this to get started. Even just a destination and dates will produce a usable itinerary. But the more context you give, the more personalized the result.

## Step 1: Choose Your Destination (Let AI Help)

If you already know where you're going, skip to Step 2. But if you're still deciding, AI is surprisingly good at narrowing down options.

**How to use it:** Tell the AI your constraints and let it suggest destinations. For example:

> "I have 5 days in late May, a $2,000 budget for two people, and we love food, walking, and architecture. We're flying from New York. Where should we go?"

A good AI trip planner will suggest destinations that match your budget, climate preferences, flight accessibility, and interests — not just a generic "top 10 destinations" list.

**Pro tip:** If you're torn between two or three options, ask the AI to generate a quick comparison. Something like: "Compare 5 days in Barcelona vs. Lisbon vs. Rome for food-focused travelers on a mid-range budget." You'll get a side-by-side breakdown that makes the decision easier.

## Step 2: Set Your Budget and Travel Style

This is where most people underestimate how much detail helps. "Medium budget" means different things to different people. Be specific.

**Budget levels that AI tools understand well:**

- **Budget**: $50-80/day per person (hostels, street food, free activities, public transit)
- **Mid-range**: $100-200/day per person (boutique hotels, sit-down restaurants, paid museums and tours)
- **Comfort**: $200-400/day per person (4-star hotels, fine dining, private tours, premium experiences)

**Travel style inputs that make a real difference:**

- "We prefer walking over taxis"
- "We're not morning people — nothing before 10 AM"
- "We want at least 2 hours of free time each afternoon"
- "We'd rather eat at local spots than Michelin-starred restaurants"
- "We have a toddler, so kid-friendly activities only"

Let's say you want to plan a 5-day trip to Barcelona on a mid-range budget. You'd tell the AI something like:

> "5 days in Barcelona, two adults, $150/day per person. We love food and architecture, prefer walking, and want a mix of famous landmarks and local neighborhoods. No beach days. We like to start around 9:30 AM and wrap up by 8 PM."

That's enough for the AI to produce something genuinely tailored — not a copy-paste list of "top 10 things to do in Barcelona."

## Step 3: Generate Your AI Itinerary

Now for the part that feels almost too easy. You enter your details into an AI trip planner and hit generate. In about 30 seconds to 2 minutes, you'll have a complete day-by-day itinerary.

Here's what a good AI-generated itinerary includes:

- **Day-by-day structure** with morning, afternoon, and evening blocks
- **Specific venues** — not "visit a local restaurant" but "Lunch at La Pepita (tapas, rated 4.4, ~$18/person)"
- **Time estimates** — how long each activity takes and transit time between stops
- **Cost breakdowns** — per activity and per day, so you can see where your budget is going
- **Geographic routing** — activities grouped by neighborhood to minimize backtracking

**What this looks like in practice:** Using [MonkeyTravel](https://monkeytravel.app), you'd enter "Barcelona, 5 days, mid-range budget, food + architecture." The AI generates a full itinerary — Day 1 might cluster Gothic Quarter activities together (Barcelona Cathedral, El Born neighborhood, tapas at Cal Pep) while Day 3 focuses on Gaudi landmarks (Sagrada Familia in the morning, Park Guell in the afternoon, dinner in Gracia).

This geographic clustering is one of AI's biggest advantages over manual planning. Humans tend to plan by priority ("I want to see Sagrada Familia and La Boqueria and Park Guell") without thinking about the 45 minutes of transit between each one. AI routes your day like a GPS routes a road trip — efficiently.

**Important:** Not all AI trip planners are equal. General chatbots like ChatGPT will give you a paragraph of suggestions. Dedicated trip planners like MonkeyTravel generate structured itineraries with verified venues and real pricing. The difference matters. If a tool can't tell you the actual name and rating of a restaurant, it's guessing — and AI guesses (called hallucinations) are the biggest risk in AI trip planning.

## Step 4: Review and Customize

Here's where your judgment kicks in. The AI itinerary is a first draft — a very good first draft — but it's not gospel.

**What to look for when reviewing:**

1. **Pacing.** AI tends to pack too much into each day. If you see 6+ activities on a single day, cut it to 3-4 and leave room for wandering, coffee breaks, and unexpected discoveries. The best travel moments are usually unplanned.

2. **Personal preferences.** The AI doesn't know that you spent 3 hours at the Prado last time and want to skip museums this trip. Remove anything that doesn't excite you and replace it with what does.

3. **Opening hours and closures.** Most AI tools use current data, but double-check that the specific museum isn't closed on Mondays or the restaurant hasn't just shuttered. A quick Google search per venue takes 30 seconds.

4. **Local events.** Check if there's a festival, holiday, or major event during your dates. AI sometimes misses these. A local holiday might mean closed shops — or it might mean an amazing street festival you should plan around.

5. **The friend factor.** Your friend recommended a specific ramen shop in Tokyo? Swap it in. Your cousin said to skip a particular tourist trap? Remove it. AI gives you the structure; your network gives you the insider tips.

**How to customize in MonkeyTravel:** You can swap activities, change time slots, adjust the budget tier for specific days, and add your own items. The itinerary recalculates automatically — budget totals update, travel times adjust, and the day rebalances itself.

## Step 5: Handle Flights, Hotels, and Bookings

Your AI itinerary covers what to do, but you still need to get there and sleep somewhere. Here's how to handle the booking layer efficiently.

**Flights:**

- Use Google Flights or Skyscanner to find the best prices for your dates
- Book directly with the airline when possible (easier to change or cancel)
- If your dates are flexible, check "flexible dates" tools — even a 1-day shift can save $100+

**Hotels:**

- Your AI itinerary tells you which neighborhoods you'll be spending the most time in — use that to pick your hotel location
- For the Barcelona example: if Days 1-3 focus on Gothic Quarter/El Born and Days 4-5 focus on Eixample/Gracia, staying near Placa Catalunya puts you central to both

**Advance bookings:**

- Your AI itinerary should flag activities that require advance tickets (Sagrada Familia, Anne Frank House, Uffizi Gallery, etc.)
- Book these immediately — popular attractions sell out weeks ahead
- For restaurants, check if reservation apps like Resy or TheFork are used in your destination

**Pro tip:** Some AI trip planners let you export your itinerary to Google Maps, so every venue is pinned and you can see exactly where everything is relative to your hotel.

## Step 6: Share with Travel Companions

Solo travelers can skip this step. But if you're traveling with a partner, family, or group, this is where AI trip planning really shines.

The traditional way to plan a group trip involves a group chat with 200 messages, three competing Google Docs, and someone who "doesn't care, anything is fine" until they veto every restaurant. It's chaos.

**The AI-assisted way:**

1. Generate your AI itinerary as the starting point
2. Share it with your travel companions
3. Everyone reviews and suggests changes
4. You finalize together — working from a concrete plan instead of a blank page

Starting from a complete draft eliminates the "so... what should we do?" paralysis. People find it much easier to react to a plan ("I'd swap this restaurant for sushi" or "Can we do the hike on Day 3 instead?") than to build one from scratch.

If you're planning a trip with friends, check out our [group trip planning guide](/blog/how-to-plan-a-group-trip) for strategies that actually keep everyone happy — and speaking to each other by the end of the trip.

## Step 7: Download and Go

Your itinerary is finalized. Bookings are made. Everyone's aligned. Now make it accessible.

**Before you leave:**

- **Download an offline version** of your itinerary (PDF or screenshot) in case you don't have cell service
- **Save venue addresses** in Google Maps as a list — you can star each location for easy navigation
- **Screenshot key confirmations** — hotel check-in details, museum ticket QR codes, restaurant reservations
- **Check the weather** one more time and adjust your packing if needed

**During the trip:**

- Use your itinerary as a guide, not a rulebook. If you're having an amazing time at a cafe and don't want to leave for the next museum, don't. The itinerary will still be there tomorrow.
- If plans change (rain, closures, spontaneous detours), you can regenerate or adjust specific days without rebuilding everything
- Take notes on what you loved — it helps AI planners learn your preferences for next time

## AI Trip Planning Tips and Tricks

After watching thousands of people plan trips with AI, here are the patterns that separate good trips from great ones:

**1. Be specific about what you *don't* want.** "No chain restaurants. No activities that require more than 30 minutes of transit. No shopping districts." Negative constraints are surprisingly powerful inputs.

**2. Plan one "wildcard" day.** Leave one day mostly empty — just a neighborhood to wander and a couple of restaurant options. These open days consistently produce the best travel memories.

**3. Use AI for the boring research, not the exciting choices.** Let AI figure out transit routes, opening hours, and geographic clustering. Make the big decisions yourself — which restaurants, which landmarks, which neighborhoods feel right.

**4. Regenerate if the first result feels off.** AI itineraries aren't deterministic. Running the same inputs again often produces a different (sometimes better) plan. Try generating 2-3 versions and cherry-pick the best parts of each.

**5. Check one thing manually: "Is this place still open?"** AI's biggest weakness is data freshness. A 30-second Google search for each key restaurant and activity catches 95% of potential issues.

**6. Adjust the budget after generating.** Start with "mid-range" to see the full range of options, then selectively upgrade the experiences that matter most (that one incredible dinner) and downgrade the ones that don't (lunch can be street food).

**7. Don't forget the in-between moments.** AI plans activities but not the walk between them. Some of the best parts of a trip happen in transit — the street market you pass on the way to the museum, the viewpoint you stumble onto between stops.

## FAQ: Common Questions About AI Trip Planning

### How long does it take to plan a trip with AI?

The AI generates a complete itinerary in 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Reviewing, customizing, and finalizing takes another 10-15 minutes. Compare that to 10-16 hours of traditional research and planning. Even with booking flights and hotels separately, most people go from "zero plan" to "ready to travel" in under an hour.

### Is AI trip planning free?

Many AI trip planners offer free tiers. [MonkeyTravel](https://monkeytravel.app) lets you generate personalized itineraries for free with real venue data and budget breakdowns. General chatbots like ChatGPT are also free for basic queries, but they lack the structured itinerary format, verified venues, and geographic routing that dedicated trip planners provide.

### Can I trust AI restaurant and activity recommendations?

It depends on the tool. General chatbots sometimes hallucinate — they'll confidently recommend a restaurant that doesn't exist. Dedicated AI trip planners like MonkeyTravel pull from Google Places and verified review data, so the venues are real, the ratings are accurate, and the prices are current. That said, always do a quick check on opening hours and recent closures before your trip, especially for restaurants.

### What if I'm planning a trip for a large group?

AI is actually *better* for group trips than solo trips. It generates a neutral starting point that everyone can react to, instead of one person's preferences dominating the plan. Share the AI itinerary with your group, collect feedback, and adjust. No more 200-message group chat debates about what to do on Day 3. For more detail, read our [complete group trip planning guide](/blog/how-to-plan-a-group-trip).

### Does AI work for complex multi-city trips?

Yes, and this is one of AI's strongest use cases. Multi-city trips involve layered logistics — train schedules, different hotel check-in times, varying opening hours across cities, and the constant question of "how many days should we spend in each place?" AI handles this complexity instantly. For a 10-day Italy trip covering Rome, Florence, and the Amalfi Coast, an AI planner will allocate days per city, factor in travel time between them, and build each city's itinerary around its specific geography and attractions.

### How is an AI trip planner different from just using ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI that can talk about travel, but it doesn't have access to real-time venue data, can't verify that a restaurant is still open, and outputs unstructured text rather than a day-by-day itinerary with time slots. A dedicated AI trip planner connects to Google Places, review databases, and pricing data to give you specific, verified recommendations organized into a structured, actionable plan. Think of it this way: ChatGPT is like asking a well-read friend for advice. A dedicated AI trip planner is like hiring a research assistant who checks every fact.
