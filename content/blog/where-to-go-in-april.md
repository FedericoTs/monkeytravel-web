# Where to Go in April 2026: 12 Best Spring Destinations Worldwide

April is when travel gets interesting. The Northern Hemisphere wakes up — cherry blossoms peak in Japan, tulips explode across the Netherlands, and Mediterranean Europe enters its sweetest window before the summer hordes arrive. In Southeast Asia, the shoulder season delivers heat with fewer crowds. And if you time it around Easter (April 5, 2026), you can tap into long-weekend deals or dodge the holiday surge entirely by shifting your dates a week.

The catch is that April weather is a mixed bag. Tokyo can swing from 12°C to 24°C in the same week. Greece is gorgeous for hiking but too cold for swimming. And Southeast Asia is at the tail end of dry season — hot, yes, but not yet monsoon-drenched. Picking the right destination for April means matching the weather window to what you actually want to do.

We evaluated 12 destinations across four categories — spring, beach, cultural, and adventure — based on April-specific weather data, realistic daily costs (accommodation, food, transport, one activity per day — flights excluded since they vary by origin), crowd levels, and events or conditions that make April the right month to go.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Destination | Avg Temp | Budget/Day | Crowd Level | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tokyo, Japan | 14-20°C (57-68°F) | $80-140 | High | Cherry blossoms, food |
| Amsterdam, Netherlands | 8-14°C (46-57°F) | $100-170 | Medium-High | Tulips, cycling, culture |
| Paris, France | 9-16°C (48-61°F) | $110-180 | Medium | Spring gardens, museums |
| Santorini, Greece | 14-20°C (57-68°F) | $80-140 | Low-Medium | Hiking, photography, wine |
| Barcelona, Spain | 12-19°C (54-66°F) | $80-130 | Low-Medium | Architecture, food, beaches |
| Rome, Italy | 10-19°C (50-66°F) | $90-150 | Medium | Easter, history, food |
| Marrakech, Morocco | 13-26°C (55-79°F) | $40-75 | Low-Medium | Souks, gardens, value |
| Bali, Indonesia | 27-30°C (81-86°F) | $40-80 | Low-Medium | Beach, temples, wellness |
| Lisbon, Portugal | 12-19°C (54-66°F) | $70-110 | Low | City break, food, value |
| Jordan (Petra & Wadi Rum) | 16-25°C (61-77°F) | $60-120 | Medium | History, desert, hiking |
| Dubrovnik, Croatia | 12-17°C (54-63°F) | $70-120 | Low | History, coast, value |
| Medellin, Colombia | 17-28°C (63-82°F) | $40-80 | Low | Eternal spring, nightlife |

## Spring Destinations

April is defined by spring. These destinations do it best.

### 1. Tokyo, Japan — Cherry Blossom Season

**Why April:** This is the reason millions of people travel in April. Tokyo's cherry blossoms (sakura) typically reach full bloom in late March, but the petals linger into the first two weeks of April — and 2026 forecasts predict peak bloom around March 28 in Tokyo and April 1-2 in Kyoto and Osaka. Early April delivers the iconic hanami (flower viewing) experience: pink canopies over rivers and parks, picnic blankets everywhere, and a buzz of celebration that is genuinely unlike anything else in world travel.

**Avg temp:** 14-20°C (57-68°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-140/person
**Crowd level:** High (first two weeks), Medium (late April)
**Best for:** Culture lovers, photographers, foodies

[Tokyo](/destinations/tokyo) in cherry blossom season is expensive relative to the rest of the year — hotel prices spike 40-60% — but daily costs outside accommodation remain reasonable. A bowl of ramen runs $8-10, train rides across the city cost $2-4, and entry to most parks and temples is free or under $5. Convenience store meals (onigiri, bento boxes) are excellent and cost $3-5.

**What to do:** Walk along the Meguro River at sunrise for the most photographed sakura spot in Tokyo. Picnic under the trees in Ueno Park or Shinjuku Gyoen ($2 entry). Visit Senso-ji temple in Asakusa. Day trip to Kamakura for coastal temples and fewer crowds. In Kyoto, walk the Philosopher's Path — a cherry-tree-lined canal that peaks in early April.

**Insider tip:** If you arrive after the petals have fallen in Tokyo, head north. Sendai peaks around April 11, and Sapporo in Hokkaido does not hit full bloom until late April. A JR Pass lets you chase the bloom north for a fraction of individual ticket costs. For a complete plan, see our [cherry blossom season guide](/blog/japan-cherry-blossom-season-guide).

### 2. Amsterdam, Netherlands — Tulip Season

**Why April:** [Amsterdam](/destinations/amsterdam) in April is tulip season at its peak. Keukenhof Gardens — the world's largest flower garden — is open from March 19 to May 10 in 2026, but the best tulip displays happen from mid-April onward. The famous Bloemencorso (Flower Parade) is on April 18, 2026. Beyond tulips, Amsterdam's canal-side trees are greening, outdoor terraces reopen, and the city shakes off winter with an energy that is palpable.

**Avg temp:** 8-14°C (46-57°F)
**Daily budget:** $100-170/person
**Crowd level:** Medium-High (especially Keukenhof)
**Best for:** Nature lovers, photographers, couples

Amsterdam is not cheap, but it rewards walkers. Rent a bike ($12-15/day) and explore like a local. The Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum cost $20-22 each but are world-class. A herring sandwich from a street stand costs $4. Indonesian rijsttafel — Amsterdam's signature multicourse meal — runs $25-35 per person and is an essential experience.

**What to do:** Spend a full day at Keukenhof ($20 entry, book online to skip lines). Cycle through the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region) tulip fields between Leiden and Haarlem — free and less crowded than Keukenhof. Visit the Anne Frank House (book 6 weeks ahead, $16). Walk the Jordaan neighborhood for galleries, cafes, and canal views.

**Insider tip:** Keukenhof on the Flower Parade day (April 18) sells out months in advance. Visit on a weekday morning instead — the gardens are 60% less crowded before 11 AM. The tulip fields surrounding Keukenhof are free to view from the road, and many are at peak color in mid-to-late April.

---

### 3. Paris, France — Spring Gardens and Shoulder Season

**Why April:** [Paris](/destinations/paris) in April is the city at its most photogenic. The Luxembourg Gardens, Tuileries, and Jardin des Plantes burst with cherry blossoms, magnolias, and tulips. Cafe terraces fill up again. The light turns soft and golden. And because it is shoulder season — after winter but before the June-August tsunami of tourists — prices are 20-30% lower than summer and queues at the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay are actually manageable.

**Avg temp:** 9-16°C (48-61°F)
**Daily budget:** $110-180/person
**Crowd level:** Medium (higher around Easter)
**Best for:** Couples, art lovers, foodies

Paris is always expensive, but April softens the blow. A croque-monsieur at a neighborhood cafe costs $8-10. A carafe of house wine with dinner is $5-8. The Paris Museum Pass ($62 for 2 days) covers 50+ museums and lets you skip the ticket line. Metro rides are $2.15 each, or $16.90 for a 10-trip carnet.

**What to do:** Cherry blossoms at Square Rene Viviani near Notre-Dame. Walk the Promenade Plantee, Paris's original elevated park. Visit Musee d'Orsay on a Thursday evening (open until 9:45 PM with smaller crowds). Sunday morning at the Marche d'Aligre flea market. Take the RER to Versailles — the gardens are free on weekdays in April and the fountains start their seasonal shows.

**Insider tip:** Easter weekend (April 3-5, 2026) brings a spike in hotel prices and crowds at major landmarks. If you can, arrive the week after Easter for the same spring weather at 15-20% lower prices. Our [3-day Paris itinerary](/blog/3-day-paris-itinerary) maps out the best route through the city.

---

## Beach & Warm Weather

Guaranteed heat, swimmable water, and the kind of prices that come with traveling slightly off-peak.

### 4. Bali, Indonesia — Start of Dry Season

**Why April:** April marks the beginning of [Bali](/destinations/bali)'s dry season, and the island knows it — prices have not yet climbed to the July-August peak, but the rain has largely stopped. You get sunny mornings, warm water (28°C / 82°F), and a version of Bali that is green from the wet season but dry enough to enjoy consistently. Hotel rates are 25-35% lower than peak season.

**Avg temp:** 27-30°C (81-86°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-80/person
**Crowd level:** Low-Medium
**Best for:** Budget travelers, surfers, wellness seekers

Bali's cost of living makes it one of the best-value tropical destinations in the world. A private villa in Ubud goes for $80-120/night in April. Warungs serve nasi goreng for $2-3. A 60-minute Balinese massage costs $8-12. Surf lessons at Kuta or Canggu run $25-35 for two hours.

**What to do:** Explore the Tegallalang Rice Terraces at sunrise. Surf at Uluwatu or Padang Padang — April swells are consistent on the west coast. Day trip to Nusa Penida for Kelingking Beach. Yoga retreat in Ubud (drop-in classes $8-12). Visit Tirta Empul water temple for a purification ceremony.

**Insider tip:** Skip Kuta and Seminyak if you want peace. Stay in Canggu for the surf-and-coffee scene, or Sidemen in east Bali for rice-terrace views without Ubud's crowds. Check out our [Bali 7-day itinerary](/blog/bali-7-day-itinerary) for a first-timer's route.

---

### 5. Medellin, Colombia — Eternal Spring

**Why April:** Medellin sits at 1,500 meters in the Andes and enjoys spring-like weather year-round — locals call it the "City of Eternal Spring." April falls in a transitional period between dry and wet seasons, meaning afternoon showers are possible but mornings are reliably warm and sunny. The real draw: Medellin is one of the most affordable cities in the Americas for the quality of experience you get, and April crowds are minimal.

**Avg temp:** 17-28°C (63-82°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-80/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** Digital nomads, nightlife, city culture

A private Airbnb in El Poblado runs $30-50/night. A meal at a local restaurant costs $4-8. A craft beer at a rooftop bar is $3-4. The Metro is $0.80 per ride and covers the entire city, including the cable cars (Metrocable) that climb into the hillside comunas.

**What to do:** Ride the Metrocable to Parque Arvi for hiking and views. Walk through Comuna 13 — once the most dangerous neighborhood in the world, now a street-art gallery with escalators, murals, and hip-hop performances. Explore the Botanical Garden (free entry). Day trip to Guatape, a lakeside town with a 700-step climb to a monolithic rock offering 360-degree views ($4 entry).

**Insider tip:** Stay in Laureles instead of El Poblado. It is cheaper, more residential, and the nightlife scene along Carrera 70 is where locals actually go out. Flights from the US are often $250-350 round trip in April.

---

## Cultural Destinations

History, architecture, and food — without fighting through summer crowds.

### 6. Rome, Italy — Easter and Shoulder Season

**Why April:** April in [Rome](/destinations/rome) is a double-edged sword. Easter Sunday (April 5, 2026) brings the Pope's Mass at St. Peter's Square — one of the most significant cultural events in the Christian calendar — along with packed hotels and peak pricing for that long weekend. But step outside the Easter window (arrive April 8 onward) and you get Rome at its finest: warm enough for outdoor dining, cool enough for walking 15 km a day, and crowd levels that let you actually see the Sistine Chapel ceiling without being sardined.

**Avg temp:** 10-19°C (50-66°F)
**Daily budget:** $90-150/person
**Crowd level:** Medium (High during Easter weekend)
**Best for:** History lovers, foodies, couples

Rome rewards slow exploration. A supplì (fried rice ball) from a street window costs $2. A plate of cacio e pepe in Trastevere is $10-12. Espresso at the bar costs $1.20 — sit down and it doubles. The Roma Pass ($32 for 48 hours) covers two museums plus unlimited public transport.

**What to do:** The Colosseum and Roman Forum with a combined ticket ($18, book online). Vatican Museums on a Friday afternoon when crowds thin. Trastevere for dinner — walk across the Tiber at sunset. Toss a coin in the Trevi Fountain. Day trip to Tivoli for Villa d'Este's Renaissance gardens (open in April, $12 entry, far fewer tourists than anything in central Rome).

**Insider tip:** If you are in Rome for Easter, attend the Via Crucis (Stations of the Cross) at the Colosseum on Good Friday evening — it is free, candlelit, and deeply atmospheric even for non-religious travelers. Book accommodation 3-4 months ahead for Easter weekend. Our [5-day Italy itinerary](/blog/5-day-italy-itinerary) pairs Rome with Florence and the Amalfi Coast.

---

### 7. Marrakech, Morocco — Spring in the Souks

**Why April:** [Marrakech](/destinations/marrakech) in April delivers warm sunshine without the punishing 40°C+ heat of summer. The city's gardens — including the iconic Jardin Majorelle — are in full bloom. The Atlas Mountains still have snow on the peaks, creating a dramatic backdrop. And April is shoulder season, meaning riad prices drop and the souks are intense but not overwhelming.

**Avg temp:** 13-26°C (55-79°F)
**Daily budget:** $40-75/person
**Crowd level:** Low-Medium
**Best for:** Culture seekers, photographers, budget travelers

Marrakech is extraordinary value. A night in a traditional riad with breakfast runs $30-60. A tagine at a local restaurant costs $4-6. A guided tour of the medina is $15-25. Hammam (traditional bath) experiences range from $5 for a local hammam to $30-50 for a tourist-oriented spa.

**What to do:** Get lost in the Medina — deliberately. Visit Jardin Majorelle ($8 entry) and the adjacent Yves Saint Laurent Museum ($4). Explore the Bahia Palace ($8). Watch the Djemaa el-Fna square transform from daytime market to nighttime food carnival. Day trip to the Atlas Mountains for a guided hike through Berber villages ($30-50 per person including transport and lunch).

**Insider tip:** Negotiate everything in the souks — start at 30% of the asking price and settle around 50-60%. Friday is prayer day, so some shops close in the afternoon, but the city has a quieter, more authentic feel. April sometimes overlaps with Ramadan — if so, expect some restaurants to close during daytime but vibrant evening markets with special dishes.

---

### 8. Lisbon, Portugal — Pre-Season Perfection

**Why April:** [Lisbon](/destinations/lisbon) in April is Europe's best-kept shoulder-season secret. The weather is already warm and sunny, the outdoor terraces in Alfama are open, and the tourist crowds that pack the city from June through September are still weeks away. Prices for accommodation are 30-40% lower than summer, and you can walk into most restaurants without a reservation.

**Avg temp:** 12-19°C (54-66°F)
**Daily budget:** $70-110/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** City-break lovers, foodies, budget-conscious travelers

Lisbon remains one of Western Europe's best values. A pastel de nata and espresso costs under $3. Grilled fish lunch at a neighborhood tasca runs $10-14. Tram 28 across the city is $3.25. The LisbonCard ($23 for 24 hours) includes free transport and entry to most museums.

**What to do:** Ride Tram 28 through Alfama and Graca. Visit the Jeronimos Monastery ($12) and Belem Tower ($10). Walk the waterfront from Cais do Sodre to Belem. Sunset from the Miradouro da Graca viewpoint (free). Day trip to Sintra for fairy-tale palaces ($15 entry to Pena Palace, 40 minutes by train from Lisbon, $5 round trip).

**Insider tip:** Skip the tourist restaurants in Alfama. Walk 10 minutes to Mouraria — Lisbon's most multicultural neighborhood — for meals at half the price and twice the flavor. For a neighborhood-by-neighborhood plan, check our [Lisbon 3-day itinerary](/blog/lisbon-3-day-itinerary).

---

### 9. Santorini, Greece — Before the Crowds

**Why April:** Santorini in April is a completely different island from the July-August version. The cruise ships have not arrived in force, the caldera villages are quiet enough to photograph without tourists in every frame, and the light is clear and golden. The trade-off: sea temperatures are around 17°C (63°F), so swimming is off the table. But if your priority is hiking the caldera trail, visiting wineries, and experiencing the iconic whitewashed villages in peace, April is the optimal month.

**Avg temp:** 14-20°C (57-68°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-140/person
**Crowd level:** Low-Medium
**Best for:** Couples, photographers, hikers

April pricing on Santorini is dramatically lower than summer. A caldera-view hotel room that costs $300-500/night in August goes for $100-180 in April. Restaurants are quieter and often friendlier. Wine tastings at local vineyards run $15-25 per person for 4-5 wines — Assyrtiko, the island's volcanic white wine, is world-class and at its best from Santorini's own vineyards.

**What to do:** Hike the Fira-to-Oia trail along the caldera rim (10 km, 3-4 hours, free, stunning views the entire way). Wine tasting at Santo Wines, Venetsanos, or Gavalas — all with caldera views. Visit the Akrotiri archaeological site ($14), a Minoan city preserved by volcanic ash. Catch the Oia sunset without the summer crowds — you might actually get a seat.

**Insider tip:** Greek Orthodox Easter falls on April 12 in 2026. If you time your visit for Easter weekend, you will experience one of Greece's most atmospheric celebrations — candlelit processions, midnight church services, and lamb roasting across the island on Easter Sunday. Hotels book fast for this weekend, so plan ahead.

---

## Adventure Destinations

For travelers who want to move, explore, and earn their views.

### 10. Jordan — Petra, Wadi Rum, and the Dead Sea

**Why April:** April is one of the best months to visit Jordan. The scorching summer heat has not yet arrived, wildflowers bloom across the desert, and the hiking conditions at Petra and Wadi Rum are ideal — warm days (24-25°C / 75-77°F) and cool nights. It is also high season, so all facilities are fully operational, but the crowds are manageable compared to the Christmas/New Year surge.

**Avg temp:** 16-25°C (61-77°F)
**Daily budget:** $60-120/person
**Crowd level:** Medium
**Best for:** Adventure seekers, history buffs, photographers

Jordan offers a remarkable range of experiences in a compact country. The Jordan Pass ($78-88 depending on Petra days) covers visa fees plus entry to Petra, Wadi Rum, Jerash, and 40+ other sites — it pays for itself immediately. Accommodation ranges from $20-40/night in Amman guesthouses to $80-150 for Wadi Rum luxury camps under the stars.

**What to do:** Spend two full days at Petra — the Treasury is just the beginning. Hike to the Monastery via 800 rock-carved steps. Sleep under the stars in a Bedouin camp in Wadi Rum ($40-80 per person including dinner and jeep tour). Float in the Dead Sea (lowest point on Earth). Explore Jerash, one of the best-preserved Roman cities outside Italy.

**Insider tip:** Visit Petra at sunrise when the gorge (Siq) is empty and the Treasury glows in morning light. The "Petra by Night" experience (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday — $20) is candle-lit and atmospheric. Book Wadi Rum camps directly with Bedouin operators for better prices than booking sites.

---

### 11. Dubrovnik, Croatia — Mediterranean Without the Mayhem

**Why April:** Dubrovnik in April is the antidote to its own summer reputation. The Game of Thrones crowds and cruise-ship floods of July-August are months away. The Old Town's limestone streets glow in spring light, the Adriatic sparkles, and you can walk the city walls without queuing. Temperatures are comfortable for all-day walking, and accommodation prices are a fraction of peak season.

**Avg temp:** 12-17°C (54-63°F)
**Daily budget:** $70-120/person
**Crowd level:** Low
**Best for:** History lovers, walkers, photographers

April is when Dubrovnik is genuinely affordable. Hotels and apartments in the Old Town that charge $200-400/night in August drop to $60-120 in April. A seafood dinner for two at a konoba (traditional restaurant) runs $30-50. The Sponza Palace is free to enter in April. Kayaking around the city walls costs $30-45 for a guided sunset tour.

**What to do:** Walk the complete city walls ($35, best at 8 AM before day-trippers arrive). Ferry to Lokrum Island ($8 round trip, 15 minutes) for botanical gardens and peacocks. Cable car to Mount Srd for panoramic views ($24 round trip). Day trip to the Elafiti Islands — Lopud has a sandy beach and zero cars. Explore Cavtat, a quieter coastal town 20 minutes south by bus ($3).

**Insider tip:** Many restaurants and tour operators open for the season in early-to-mid April. By the third week, everything is running but the crowds have not arrived. It is the true sweet spot. If you are planning a broader Adriatic itinerary, pair Dubrovnik with Montenegro (Kotor is 2 hours south by bus, $15).

---

### 12. Barcelona, Spain — Spring Architecture and Food

**Why April:** [Barcelona](/destinations/barcelona) in April hits the sweet spot between winter chill and summer sweat. The temperature is perfect for spending full days outdoors — walking La Rambla, exploring Park Guell, eating patatas bravas at an outdoor terrace — without the July-August heat that makes afternoon sightseeing miserable. Beach season has not officially started (water is 15°C / 59°F), which keeps the party-tourist numbers low and lets you experience the city's architecture and food scene with breathing room.

**Avg temp:** 12-19°C (54-66°F)
**Daily budget:** $80-130/person
**Crowd level:** Low-Medium
**Best for:** Architecture fans, foodies, city explorers

Barcelona's food scene alone justifies the trip. A menu del dia (fixed lunch menu) at a local restaurant runs $12-16 for three courses plus wine. Patatas bravas and a cana (small beer) at a tapas bar cost $6-8. La Boqueria market has fresh fruit, jamon iberico, and seafood stands where you can build a lunch for under $10.

**What to do:** Visit the Sagrada Familia (book online, $28, absolutely non-negotiable). Park Guell early morning ($11, buy timed tickets). Walk the Gothic Quarter. Eat pintxos in El Born. Day trip to Montserrat for the mountain monastery and hiking trails (1 hour by train, $15 round trip). Catch a sunset at Bunkers del Carmel — the locals' favorite viewpoint, free.

**Insider tip:** The Barcelona Card ($23/day) covers unlimited transport and 25+ museum entries, but only makes sense if you are museum-hopping. For food, skip La Boqueria at lunchtime (tourist prices) and go at 8-9 AM when the vendors are setting up and selling to locals. Our [Barcelona 3-day itinerary](/blog/barcelona-3-day-itinerary) maps the best walking routes.

## April Travel Tips: Easter, Spring Break, and Shoulder-Season Strategy

### Easter 2026 Dates and Impact

Easter Sunday falls on April 5, 2026 (Western) and April 12, 2026 (Orthodox). This creates two travel spikes:

- **April 3-6:** Peak pricing in Catholic/Protestant Europe (Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Lisbon). Hotels sell out and flights spike 25-40%.
- **April 10-13:** Peak pricing in Orthodox countries (Greece, Croatia, parts of Eastern Europe). Santorini and Dubrovnik see a short surge.

**Strategy:** If Easter is not the reason for your trip, travel the week of April 13-20 (after Western Easter, during or after Orthodox Easter). You get the same spring weather at shoulder-season prices.

### Spring Break Overlap

Most US spring breaks fall between March 8 and April 20 in 2026. By mid-April, the spring break crowd has largely returned home, making the second half of the month the sweet spot for lower prices on Caribbean and Mexico routes. Economy fares for international flights are trending 7% cheaper than 2025.

### Cherry Blossom Timing

- **Tokyo:** Full bloom forecast around March 28. Petals linger through April 7-10.
- **Kyoto/Osaka:** Full bloom April 1-2. Peak viewing first week of April.
- **Sendai:** Full bloom around April 11.
- **Sapporo (Hokkaido):** Full bloom around April 30 — the late option for those who missed the main season.
- **Amsterdam:** Tulip fields peak mid-to-late April. Keukenhof is best April 12-25.
- **Paris:** Cherry blossoms in parks and gardens peak first two weeks of April.

### Booking Strategy

For the best April prices, book 3-4 months ahead for long-haul flights (you should already be booking) and 6-8 weeks ahead for European short-haul. Use [MonkeyTravel's AI trip planner](/) to compare destination costs and build a day-by-day itinerary tailored to your budget and travel style — it handles the logistics so you can focus on choosing where to go.

## FAQ

### What is the cheapest destination to visit in April 2026?

Marrakech and Medellin consistently offer the best value for April travel, with realistic daily budgets of $40-75 per person including mid-range accommodation, meals, and activities. Bali matches this range at $40-80/day, though flight costs from Europe or North America are higher. For a European option, [Lisbon](/destinations/lisbon) at $70-110/day and [Istanbul](/destinations/istanbul) at $40-70/day offer remarkable value relative to the experience.

### Is April too early for beach trips in Europe?

For swimming, yes — Mediterranean water temperatures in April range from 15-17°C (59-63°F), which is too cold for most people. Santorini, Dubrovnik, and Barcelona are excellent in April for hiking, sightseeing, and dining outdoors, but you will not be swimming comfortably. If you need warm water, head to Bali (28°C / 82°F) or the Caribbean coast of Colombia (27°C / 81°F). European beach season starts in earnest from mid-June.

### When is the best time to see cherry blossoms in April?

The first week of April (roughly April 1-7) is the peak window for cherry blossoms in central Japan — [Tokyo](/destinations/tokyo), Kyoto, and Osaka. Petals begin to fall after about a week of full bloom. If you are traveling mid-to-late April, head to northern Japan (Sendai peaks around April 11, Sapporo around April 30). In Europe, Paris and Amsterdam both have cherry blossoms in parks during the first two weeks of April, though the displays are smaller than Japan. Our [cherry blossom season guide](/blog/japan-cherry-blossom-season-guide) covers timing in detail.

### How do Easter dates affect April travel prices?

Easter 2026 falls on April 5 (Western) and April 12 (Orthodox). The Easter long weekend (April 3-6) creates a 25-40% price spike in popular European cities — [Rome](/destinations/rome), [Paris](/destinations/paris), Barcelona, and Lisbon especially. Orthodox Easter (April 12) affects pricing in Greece, Croatia, and Eastern Europe. The smartest strategy is to travel the week of April 13-20: spring weather is identical, but prices drop back to shoulder-season levels and crowds thin noticeably.

### What should I pack for an April trip?

It depends entirely on your destination. For European cities (Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Lisbon), pack layers — mornings are cool (8-12°C / 46-54°F) and afternoons pleasant (16-20°C / 61-68°F). A light jacket, comfortable walking shoes, and a compact umbrella cover most situations. For tropical destinations (Bali, Medellin), bring breathable clothing, sunscreen, and a light rain jacket for afternoon showers. For Jordan, bring sun protection, sturdy hiking shoes for Petra, and a warm layer for desert nights when temperatures drop to 10-12°C (50-54°F).
