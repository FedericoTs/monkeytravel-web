# The Great Migration in Africa: When and Where to See It in 2026

Every year, roughly 1.5 million wildebeest, 400,000 zebras, and 200,000 gazelles make a circular journey across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. It covers about 1,800 miles. Nothing stops it — not rivers, not crocodiles, not droughts. It's been happening for over a million years, and it is, without exaggeration, the greatest wildlife spectacle on Earth.

But here's what most guides don't tell you: there is no bad time to see the Great Migration. The herds are always somewhere. The real question isn't *whether* to go — it's *when* and *where* to position yourself.

This guide breaks down the migration month by month, compares the Serengeti and Masai Mara, recommends specific camps for each season, and gives you a realistic budget breakdown so you can actually plan this trip.

## The Annual Cycle: Month by Month

The Great Migration follows a roughly clockwise loop through Tanzania's Serengeti and Kenya's Masai Mara. Rain dictates the route — the herds follow the fresh grass.

### January - March: Calving Season (Southern Serengeti / Ndutu)

This is one of the most underrated periods. The herds gather on the short-grass plains of the southern Serengeti, around the **Ndutu area** and the **Ngorongoro Conservation Area**.

- **What happens:** Around 8,000 calves are born per day during the peak (late January to mid-February). The plains are alive with newborns taking their first steps — and the predators that follow them.
- **Why it's special:** The calving season attracts huge concentrations of lions, cheetahs, and hyenas. You'll see more predator-prey interactions here than almost anywhere else on the planet.
- **Weather:** Short rains taper off in January. February-March is warm and relatively dry with dramatic afternoon thunderstorms.
- **Crowds:** Moderate. This is increasingly popular but still less crowded than the Mara River crossing season.

**Best camps for calving season:**
- **Ndutu Safari Lodge** — right in the calving grounds, great value ($350-500/night)
- **Sanctuary Ndutu Under Canvas** — luxury mobile tented camp that follows the herds ($800-1,200/night)
- **Lemala Ndutu** — tented camp on the shores of Lake Ndutu with excellent guides ($600-900/night)

### April - May: The Long Rains (Central Serengeti)

The long rains push the herds north and west. The grass in the south dries out and the migration begins its northward march through the **Central Serengeti** (Seronera Valley area).

- **What happens:** Massive columns of wildebeest move through the central plains. This is the mating season — bulls compete aggressively for cows.
- **Why it's special:** Green season means lush landscapes, fewer vehicles, and dramatically lower prices. The light is extraordinary for photography.
- **Weather:** Heavy rain, especially in April. May starts to dry out. Some roads become difficult.
- **Crowds:** Low season. Many camps offer 30-50% discounts.

**Best camps for green season:**
- **Dunia Camp** — centrally located in the Serengeti, open year-round ($400-600/night in green season)
- **Serengeti Serena Safari Lodge** — solid mid-range option with great central views ($300-500/night)

### June - July: Western Corridor & Grumeti River (Western Serengeti)

The herds push into the **Western Corridor** toward the Grumeti River. This is the first major river crossing of the cycle.

- **What happens:** Hundreds of thousands of wildebeest must cross the crocodile-infested Grumeti River. The drama is real, though crossings are less predictable than on the Mara River.
- **Why it's special:** Far fewer tourists than the Mara crossings. Exclusive, intimate game viewing.
- **Weather:** Dry and pleasant. Daytime highs around 27-29°C (80-84°F), cool mornings.
- **Crowds:** Moderate and growing. Book well ahead for the best camps.

**Best camps for the Grumeti crossing:**
- **Singita Grumeti** — among Africa's most luxurious properties, exclusive concession ($2,500-4,000/night)
- **Grumeti Serengeti Tented Camp** — more accessible luxury ($800-1,500/night)
- **Mbalageti Serengeti** — budget-friendly option on the Western Corridor ($250-400/night)

### July - October: Mara River Crossings (Northern Serengeti & Masai Mara)

This is what most people think of when they hear "Great Migration" — the dramatic, chaotic river crossings. The herds reach the **Mara River** on the border between Tanzania (Northern Serengeti) and Kenya (Masai Mara).

- **What happens:** Thousands of wildebeest gather on the riverbanks, sometimes waiting for days before plunging into the crocodile-filled river. Some crossings involve 10,000+ animals at once.
- **Why it's special:** This is the most visually dramatic event in the natural world. National Geographic footage is made here. You will never forget what you see.
- **Weather:** Dry season. Clear skies, excellent visibility. Mornings can be cold (10-15°C), warming to 25-28°C.
- **Crowds:** Peak season. The Masai Mara side is busier than the Northern Serengeti. Book 6-12 months ahead.

**Best camps for Mara River crossings — Tanzania side (Northern Serengeti):**
- **Lamai Serengeti** — perched above the Mara River, front-row seat for crossings ($1,200-2,000/night)
- **Sayari Camp** — excellent location near multiple crossing points ($1,000-1,800/night)
- **Mara Under Canvas** — mobile tented camp that repositions with the herds ($600-1,000/night)

**Best camps for Mara River crossings — Kenya side (Masai Mara):**
- **Governors' Il Moran Camp** — intimate camp right on the Mara River ($800-1,400/night)
- **Angama Mara** — stunning lodge overlooking the Mara from the escarpment ($1,200-2,000/night)
- **Mara Intrepids Camp** — solid mid-range option near the Talek River ($400-700/night)
- **Basecamp Masai Mara** — eco-friendly, good value ($200-350/night)

### November - December: Return South (Eastern Serengeti & Loliondo)

The short rains begin, and the herds start their journey back south. They pass through the **Eastern Serengeti** and the private **Loliondo concession** before spreading across the southern plains.

- **What happens:** The herds break into smaller groups and begin drifting south. The rains transform the landscape — everything turns green.
- **Why it's special:** This transition period means far fewer tourists, lower prices, and the chance to see the herds in dramatic storm-light.
- **Weather:** Short rains — afternoon showers, but mornings are often clear. November can be unpredictable.
- **Crowds:** Low. Great value.

**Best camps for the return journey:**
- **Namiri Plains** — eastern Serengeti, excellent cheetah and leopard sightings ($700-1,200/night)
- **Asilia Olakira Migration Camp** — mobile camp that follows the herds ($600-1,000/night)

## Serengeti (Tanzania) vs. Masai Mara (Kenya)

Both offer incredible migration experiences, but they're different.

| Factor | Serengeti (Tanzania) | Masai Mara (Kenya) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Migration months** | Year-round (herds always somewhere) | July - October only |
| **Size** | 14,763 km² — massive | 1,510 km² — compact |
| **Crowd levels** | Lower (more spread out) | Higher (especially Aug-Sep) |
| **River crossings** | Grumeti (Jun-Jul) + Mara from Tanzania side | Mara from Kenya side |
| **Calving season** | January-March (Ndutu) | Not available |
| **Cost** | Higher park fees ($82/day) | Lower park fees ($80/day for non-residents) |
| **Access** | Fly-in recommended (light aircraft) | Drive from Nairobi (5-6 hrs) or fly |
| **Vehicle limits** | Stricter — fewer vehicles per sighting | Less regulated, can feel crowded at crossings |

**The verdict:** If you only care about river crossings and have a limited budget, the Masai Mara is more accessible. If you want the full annual cycle, fewer crowds, and more wilderness feeling, the Serengeti wins. Many serious wildlife travelers do both on a combined Tanzania-Kenya trip.

## Practical Tips for Your Migration Safari

### Vaccinations and Health

- **Yellow fever** vaccine is required for entry to both Tanzania and Kenya (carry your certificate)
- **Recommended:** Typhoid, Hepatitis A & B, Tetanus booster
- **Malaria:** Both countries are malaria zones. Consult your doctor about prophylaxis (Malarone or Doxycycline are common choices). Start before you travel.
- **Altitude:** If visiting the Ngorongoro Crater (2,200m), drink plenty of water

### Visas

- **Tanzania:** E-visa required for most nationalities — apply at [visa.immigration.go.tz](https://visa.immigration.go.tz). Costs $50, processing 3-10 days.
- **Kenya:** eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization) — apply at [etakenya.go.ke](https://www.etakenya.go.ke). Costs $30.
- **Combined trip:** If visiting both countries, you need separate documents for each.

### What to Pack

- **Clothing:** Neutral-colored layers (khaki, olive, brown). Mornings are cold; midday is warm. Avoid blue and black — tsetse flies are attracted to dark colors.
- **Sun protection:** Wide-brimmed hat, SPF 50 sunscreen, UV sunglasses
- **Footwear:** Closed-toe shoes for game drives, comfortable walking shoes for bush walks
- **Binoculars:** Essential. 8x42 or 10x42 are ideal for safari
- **Dust protection:** A buff or bandana for dusty roads in dry season
- **Power:** Bring a universal adapter and a power bank — many camps have limited charging hours
- **Medications:** Bring everything you might need. Pharmacies in remote areas don't exist.

### Camera Gear

- **Minimum:** A camera with at least 200mm zoom. Smartphone cameras won't cut it for wildlife at distance.
- **Ideal:** 100-400mm or 200-600mm telephoto lens. Rent one if you don't own it — it's worth every dollar.
- **Extras:** Bean bag or window mount for stabilization in the vehicle, extra memory cards (you'll shoot thousands of photos), extra batteries, lens cleaning cloth for dust.
- **Drone note:** Drones are **prohibited** in both the Serengeti and Masai Mara. Don't bring one.

## FAQ

### When is the best time to see the Great Migration?

There's no single "best" time — it depends on what you want to see. For river crossings, July to October. For calving season, January to March. For lower prices and fewer crowds, April to May or November to December. The herds are always somewhere in the ecosystem.

### Can you see the Great Migration from both Tanzania and Kenya?

Yes. The migration spends most of the year (roughly October to June) in Tanzania's Serengeti and crosses into Kenya's Masai Mara from approximately July to October. You can visit either country or both on a combined trip.

### How far in advance should I book a migration safari?

For peak season (July-October), book 6-12 months ahead. The best camps sell out a year in advance. For calving season (January-March), 3-6 months is usually sufficient. Green season (April-May) can often be booked 1-3 months ahead.

### Is it safe to go on safari in Tanzania and Kenya?

Yes. Both countries have well-established tourism industries with strong safety records. Wildlife lodges and camps are professionally run. The main health concerns are malaria prevention and staying hydrated. Always follow your guide's instructions during game drives.

### Do I need to be physically fit for a migration safari?

Most migration safaris involve riding in a vehicle for game drives — no strenuous physical activity required. You will sit in a 4x4 for several hours each day, with breaks at camp. Some camps offer optional walking safaris that require moderate fitness. Hot air balloon rides over the Serengeti are also an option that requires no fitness at all.
